It's late at night and she's walking,
Cause her friends didn't wanna leave
My cell phone rings and she's talking,
Jesus Christ this is all I need

Don't worry baby I'm coming
To carry you down the street
And I will try to get there soon
Before the alcohol finds your knees

And I just hung up the phone and I think that I'm alright
Cause I am in such a better mood than I was earlier tonight

Yeah tonight yeah tonight
Yeah tonight yeah tonight
Yeah tonight.

And he knows he's making money the dirty way
But he could not care less cause he's got bills to pay

And his friends are coming later,
They don't plan to stay.
And he already cleared his history three times today.

He doesn't like the cut scenes and the way it fades.
But she could not care less because her bills are being paid.
And she'll go to church and pray to god one day
But is she getting into heaven?
There is no fucking way.

Just hung up the phone and she could go back to sleep
But she is pretty sure at this point in his life,
Her love is all she needs

Well I just hung up the phone
And I could go back to sleep.
But I am gonna walk around this town
Until I find you on the street.

And I will pick you up in my arms
And I will carry you to your house
And I will put you in your bed
And by tomorrow morning you won't remember a thing I said.

Will you come over tonight? I need some inspiration for my story.
I know it's late but if you come now we'll be done by two or three in the morning.
And as you're laying on your back, I will realize we've gone too fast.
And then I'll stop writing the book because the book, I realized, was boring.

And when your parents find out where you've been
They will be singing, shame, shame, shame on you.
Shame on you.
Do as we say, not as we do.

I will come over tomorrow and get the rest of my stuff
I'll give you a hug, tell you I love you and that your love has meant so much
Then I'll try to make you laugh, I will realize it's all gone bad
And then I'll turn and walk away, see you tomorrow
But I never will see you again.

And when your parents find out where you've been
Oh, they will just keep singing, shame, shame, shame on you.
Shame on you.
Do as we say, not as we do.

I would sleep better on your floor
than I would ever in my bed
And if your carpet makes my face itch
It'd still be heaven in my head

I would play more than just four chords
If it's a song that you might like
But I am not very good
So I would practice every night

And she said, "Sometimes, things just don't work out the way you want them to,
Sometimes things just don't work out the way they should flow through,
Sometimes things just don't work out the way you want them to,
Sometimes things just don't work out, it's better me than it is you."

"Break your neck, and I will love you like a bird that cannot fly. You will be fine,"
And she says, "Break your neck, and I will love you every night. You will be mine."

I would stop doing all those things the doctor tells me not to do
But I don't think he understands, I do all of these things for you
And you've got gold plastic on your shelf that they gave to everybody else
And you can say it says your name but I don't think that that would help

And she says, "Sometimes, things just don't work out the way you want them to,
Sometimes things just don't work out the way they should flow through,
Sometimes things just don't work out the way you want them to,
Sometimes things just don't work out, it's better me than it is you."

"Break your neck, and I will love you like a bird that cannot fly. You will be fine,"
And she says, "Break your neck, and I will love you every night. You will be mine."

And today we can do something that we've never done before
Yeah today we can do something more
And today we can do something that we've never done before
Done before

And today we can do something that we've never done before
Yeah today we can do something more
And today we can do something that we've never done before
Done before

What the fuck?
How could this happen to me?
There's a million different people
walking down a million different streets

I wonder if your Mom knew, the second that the car rolled in your direction
I wonder if your mom knew, should have told about a thousand bad decisions

Stop asking questions and learn to accept
that the things that we have right now are the best things that we've had yet
It's getting dark
This wasn't part of the plan
I'm closing my eyes and I will never open them again

Oh no no, I've got numbers I could call
Start problems I don't need
Start trouble with my friends that won't even matter when I leave

And I've got numbers I could call
Start problems I don't need
Start trouble with my friends that won't even matter when I leave

Hey Molly, how you doin'?
I'm doing fine
I feel alright
No, I feel better than alright [x2]

Stumbled upon some of the art you drew
While me and your neighbors were trying to clean out your room
And it was hard, especially for your mom
Cause your friends are here and they miss you, but they will eventually move on

And I've got numbers I could call
To forget about today
But I would rather sit alone, think of things that I would say

And I would write it in a letter and I will bury it in my backyard
And we will always think about you, cause you remind us of who we are

Hey Molly, how you doin'?
I'm doing fine
I feel alright
No, I feel better than alright [x8]

I feel fine!
I feel better than alright!
I feel fine!
I feel fine!
Hey Molly!

I know, I know, I know
That I am not the only one confused
About how I felt, I felt, I felt
How this might work out
And maybe you were someone else
I’ve tried, I tried, I tried
And I gave everything I had
And I just gave up, gave up, gave up, gave up

Believe me I’ve tried, and what I found
Was what we have is nowhere near as good as what we should have by now
Goddamn these girls and goddamn their boyfriends
And goddamn the love that they share between them

Follow the sounds of the moon,
Through the air it will help you sleep
To play a part against the secrets I pretend to keep
I’ll tell a joke you'll laugh it all seems fake,
But every smile in my mouth will cooperate
And the only thing keeping me from walking away
Is every muscle in each one of my goddamn legs
On my hands and knees I will crawl to where you're not

Believe me I’ve tried, and what I found
Was what we have is nowhere near as good as what we should have by now
Goddamn these girls and goddamn their boyfriends
And goddamn the love that they share between them

It’s okay, kind of pointless, it's alright, I still regret it
I close my eyes and just pretend you never said it
I never felt whole, the timing was perfect
It’s okay, kind of pointless, you shake your hands and can’t believe I don’t forget it
You were right, you were right

Believe me I’ve tried, and what I found
Was what we have is nowhere near as good as what we should have by now
Goddamn these girls and goddamn their boyfriends
And goddamn the love that they share between them [x2]

Goddamn, I’ve tried

She's grinding her teeth
It's giving her headaches
Every breath that her words take
But she knows, that everyone of them have got to come out

Or they won't forgive her
The words will mean nothing
The only thing they need is for the words to come out

And we are so dishonest, so dishonest now
And this is what you're all about
And we are so dishonest, so dishonest now
So dishonest with ourselves

Now holding your breath and say what you're thinking
Is anybody else burning up?
Can I open a window? Should I tell them enough?
Should I tell them enough?

It's okay to give up
'Cause nobody here could care less
It's okay to give up

And we are so dishonest, so dishonest now
So dishonest with ourselves
And we are so dishonest, so dishonest now
And this is what you're all about

Keep yourself distant and remote
Unhappy and alone
Distant and remote
Unhappy and alone

And we are so dishonest, so dishonest now
So dishonest with ourselves
And we are so dishonest, so dishonest now,
And this is what you're all about

Just give me a minute and let me breathe
A little bit of air is all I need
A little bit of time to tell more lies,
Get the rest of my friends to play alibi

But time is running out and I need to choose.
The clock is moving faster than it used to move
And I keep asking questions I will never know the answers to

I say that I could leave just to let them know
That nobody here wants to be the first to go
So I'll just stand around, I could take down names
But every personality's exactly the same

Time is running out and I need to choose
The clock is moving faster than it used to move
And I keep asking questions I will never know the answers to

I got one question that I will never know the answer
Two questions that I will never know the answers
Three questions that I will never know the answers
Four questions and I will never know the answers
Five questions that I will never know the answers
Six questions that I will never know the answers
Seven questions and I will never know the answers
Eight questions and I will never know the answers
Nine questions and I will never know the answers
Ten questions that I will never know the answers to, the answers to

All the kids I used to spend my time with but now can't stand
Seem to be dying of natural causes (of natural causes)
And I could reach my arms with my two hands
In the middle of a crowded room and not touch anyone
Someone talk to me

We are so cold, we are so underground (we are so cold)
Developed in small rooms, speak up loudly now

And when I call, and I will call, make sure you throw your phone as hard as you can at the wall

Like my wisdom teeth, all my friends want out
I look nervous and I should
It's gonna hurt more than we had planned, as I split blood out of my mouth
It was nice when I woke up, but then the clouds came down like pain
But it isn't all that bad; the desert could use the rain

I need to tattoo (need to tattoo) this new black eye (so fucked up)
Shave my head to the skin to let everyone know just how

We are so cold, (we are so cold) we are so underground (we are so underground).
Developed in small rooms, speak up loudly now

And when I call, and I will call, make sure you throw your phone as hard as you can at the wall

I made a list of all the friends that I never wanna see again,
And I am sorry but your name fell below every single one of them,
High school is over and I've wasted too much time,
Making sentences of words just because they rhyme,
You wouldn't smile if you knew how I felt about every single one of you

So stop please I want to go home
But if I do I know these guys aren't gonna leave you alone
And it's my world that doesn't mean much
But I hate your friends and their influence
I'm going crazy- I've lost my mind
But this basement scene's left me so far behind
Shut down, lose everything, forget what you know,believe what you see

Now that it's over things are a little bit awkward
Avoiding all the spots so I won't have to talk to her
Sorry for playing the dickhead role
When all you ever really needed was a hand to hold
And I thought that you'd be the one thing that I could take home from all of this
I was wrong (I was wrong)

Stop please I want to go home
But if I do I know these guys aren't gonna leave you alone
And it's my world that doesn't mean much
But I hate your friends and their influence
I'm going crazy I've lost my mind
But this basement scene's left me so far behind
Shut down, lose everything, forget what you know, believe what you see
(Forget what you know believe what you see, forget what you know believe what you see)
Just leave

Stop saying hi to all of your old friends
Learn to survive on only the new trends
Does anyone else think these girls are a little too young to be here
(Little too young to be here)
They say face your fears but I can't stop running
Stop telling jokes cause they're not funny
Swore I wouldn't steal but I need some money
Swore I wouldn't steal but I need some money
(I need money, I need some money)
(Run go just go just go it doesn't matter)

Stop please I want to go home
But I know these guys aren't gonna leave you alone
And it's my world that doesn't mean much
But I hate your friends and their influence
I'm going crazy I've lost my mind
But this basement scene's left me so far behind
Shut down, lose everything, forget what you know, believe what you see
Forget what you know believe what you see, believe what you see
Love how you disagree
To tell me that I'm wrong
When every bone is healed
And every stitch is sewn

I've got some words to share
But she don't like my tone
I've got some words to share
She won't pick up her phone

She's got some medicine
She's choking on the pills
She shouldn't feel this way
A lack of social skills

He'll take her out tonight
She'll have an awesome time
The only thing that's lost
The only thing that's mine

And I'm gonna get on my knees
Would you kick me in the face please?
It'll make whatever I say sound like poetry
And as my gums begin to bleed
The words will fall like teeth
And whatever we have locked up now is free

You're talking with your friends
Secrets they'll never keep
They're sitting on your bed
And all you want is sleep

Pretend that this is fake
It helps to kill the pain
All that you want is different
All that you'll get is same

There's nothing more to say
I think I've said it all
I'm sitting on the edge
I'm waiting for the fall

I'll check my messages
They'll say you wanna fight
I'm turning off my phone
How high were you last night?

And I'm gonna get on my knees
Would you kick me in the face please?
It'll make whatever I say sound like poetry
And as my gums begin to bleed
The words will fall like teeth
And whatever we have locked up now is free

I'm gonna get on my knees
Would you kick me in the face please?
It'll make whatever I say sound like poetry
And as my gums begin to bleed
The words will fall like teeth
And whatever we have locked up now is free

And I'm scared I'm gonna die as lonely as I feel
And I'm scared I'm gonna die as lonely as I feel
And I'm scared I'm gonna die as lonely as I feel right now

I'm gonna get on my knees
Would you kick me in the face please?
It'll make whatever I say sound like poetry
And as my gums begin to bleed
The words will fall like teeth
And whatever we have locked up now is free

I'm gonna get on my knees
Would you kick me in the face please?
It'll make whatever I say sound like poetry
And as my gums begin to bleed
The words will fall like teeth
And whatever we have locked up now is free

You've got me stuck to where I'm sitting
Looking at your eyes
Then I know I'm so pathetic
I wouldn't move to save my life
They tell me that you're lonely
It's no surprise
When you walk around all day wearing those
Lonely lonely lonely lonely eyes

Well I try to tell you jokes
I'm afraid to cry
And if you need a little sunshine you can borrow some of mine
It's okay if you're unhappy I would say before I leave her
Just take a look around there's no one here that's happy either

Lonely girl you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason you don't feel like talking
I can just sit and enjoy your company
Your company

The days keep going by
And it doesn't get much better
She could be threatening to jump
And all of your friends would scream "let her"
They count on you to leave
Cause it has always been that way
But on the one day they close early
That's the one you want to stay

Lonely girl you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason you don't feel like talking
I can just sit and enjoy your company
Your company

Lonely girl you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason you don't feel like talking
I can just sit and enjoy your company
Your company, your company

You and me, we could never be
Because I don't laugh at shit that I don't think is funny
And you're so eager to please
You get on your knees for any fucking asshole
Who says he's all you need

And I'm sorry I have to take this approach
The only thing that'd shut me up now:
your hands around my throat

You and your friends feel free
And you're way too cool for me
And you do drugs now
And all your problems run so deep
And we were smoking in the basement
At your best friend's brother's party
And you love them because he treats you
Like you know what the fuck you're talking about

And you and me, we could never take this approach
The only thing that'd shut me up now:
Your hands around my throat
Swear I love you
Until the very, very end.
But there's a problem,
(What's the problem?)
You're in love with your boyfriend.

This is me officially giving up on you
I've wasted too much time with stupid lies
For this to ever become true
And this is me officially giving up on you
We've wasted too much time with stupid lies
I'm getting shitfaced in your room.

I've got dreams where I bleed
And I choke myself to sleep
And I hear screams
It's the secrets that you keep
And I am learning that your secrets
They really don't mean shit to anyone
But you and your friends

And you and me, we could never take this approach
The only thing that'd shut me up now:
Your hands around my throat
Swear I love you
Until the very, very end.
But what's the problem,
(What's the problem?)
You're in love with your boyfriend

And I will get on my elbows until all my fingers go numb
And I refuse to take another breath 'till you change who you have become
And I will lean on my elbows until all my fingers go numb
And I refuse to take another breath 'till you change who you have become
And I will lean on my elbows until all my fingers go numb
And I refuse to take another breath 'till you change who you have become

It's the ending to a sad story on a Monday afternoon
Just pick your head up from your desk
Can we please get this over with
I wonder if the wife knew, don't ask questions
Keep your head down, learn your lesson
Cause no one with money ever goes to jail

And I need to think of something to say before we all are on the floor
It's not that hard, everyone in this room probably done it 100 times before

And it is only the strong survive
And that is only the biggest lie
And I'm sorry sorry about tonight

I shaved my head last night to start anew,
In a chapter I call without you
And it's going to be the best I've ever written

I blacked my soul last night to feel like you
And the doctors don't know what to do
In a chapter I call rehabilitation

And I need to think of something to say before we all are on the floor
It's not that hard everyone in this room has probably done it 100 times before

And it is only the strong survive
And that is only the biggest lie
And I'm sorry, sorry about tonight

Mark it on a calendar and walk away
Forget the stories forget the pain
They mean nothing to you well they mean nothing to me
But the memories wont let me be
Take the pictures to remember the day
I'm forgetting the voices what they have to say
They mean nothing to you they mean nothing to me
But the memories wont let me be

It's the ending to a sad story on a monday afternoon

Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze!

Squeeze my arms a little tighter
Let me know I'm still alive
Cause you're the only one here keeping both my eyes open tonight
And I know that we got problems
Who are they to criticize
If I tell you all my secrets would you tell me all your lies
And when I stop writing her letters
I want her to know that it's because
I have someone that makes me feel the same exact way that she does
And I will not deny the privilege to someone else who wants my love
I have stitched a mask of confidence and I wear it like a glove
And a man that knows what he's talking, spoke to me today
He said that no ones going to listen until you mean every word you say
So if you can't find the feeling, you better learn to lie
And if you know we're gonna fail, then there's no point to even try
No point to try, no point try, no point to try

I don't get it for real, this is blowing my mind
We keep saying we're unhappy and they keep saying that we're fine
I guess pain will be the only thing I ever get to bring
But I will send it through the air like a loosely gripped baseball bat swing
All I ever wanted was something different, maybe by another name
We could set ourselves on fire, there is cleansing in the flame

So keep clapping and dancing
Let them know you're still alive and if you're tired of giving up
At least make them think that you survived
So keep laughing, its not funny but at least you don't have to cry
When you wake up in the morning and you know you're still alive
You're still alive, you know you're still alive
You're still alive, you know you're still alive

Until we break down, til we shut down
Until the weight of our lifeless bodies hit the ground
Until we break down, til we shut down
Until the weight of our lifeless bodies hit the ground
Until we break down, til we shut down
Until the weight of our lifeless bodies hit the ground

And a man that knows what he's talking, spoke to me today
He said that no ones going to listen until you mean every word you say
So if you can't find the feeling, you better learn to lie
And if you know we're gonna fail, then there's little point to even try
Little point to try

Don't mind me I'm only
Trying to get used to
That awkward feeling inside that comes with standing next to you
They'll ask me are you okay
And I will say yes and walk away
But I've been reading all the signs
And it's not looking good for me
Cause I will never have the balls and I will never grow the nerve
To go driving at full speed, crash head first into the curb
You are so beautiful to everyone around you
The only reason for the push-ups is the fact I know, I can't support you

If you wanna know why, I'm not sleeping tonight
It's because I'm scared you will never know
All the reasons why, I'm about to cry
The way I feel inside, the way I feel in

Bullshit conversations, won't last long
Cause you won't fake them, can't last long cause you got took away
Sitting by myself you're better off with some one else
It would have helped if I knew what to say
If I knew what to say
If I knew what to say
If I knew what to say

If I knew what to say

If you wanna know why, I'm not sleeping tonight
It's because I'm scared you will never know
All the reasons why, I'm about to cry
The way I feel inside, the way I feel in

I can't let you leave
I won't let you leave
Tonight's not his night
You're staying with me
You're so beautiful to every one around you
The only reason for the push-ups is the fact I know I can't support you

If you wanna know why, I'm not sleeping tonight
It's because I'm scared you will never know
All the reasons why, I'm about to cry
I'm about to cry
The way I feel inside, the way I feel inside

Cause you are water twelve feet deep and I am boots made of concrete
We'll wear cool clothes that show some skin,
Flash a fake, so we'll both get in
Now we're dancing, we're so drunk
We are so cool, we are so punk

And yes, we can keep living like this.
As long as you're here I will live like this.

Since when did "I wanna hear your voice" not become a good excuse?
Calling you three in the morning, laugh at sleep that we'll both lose
Maybe college won't work out, I can come live at your house
I'm supposed to be at class now but my roommate just passed out

And I cannot get in my room, get all my books and what I need
You're all I need but I am pretty sure your parents will never see
I'll let it be, 'cause it was never meant to be
I'll let it be.

Cause you are water twelve feet deep and I am boots made of concrete
We'll wear cool clothes that show some skin,
Flash a fake, so we'll both get in
Now we're dancing, we're so drunk
We are so cool, we are so punk

And yes, we can keep living like this.
As long as you're here I will live like this.

I get left out, I get left out of every plan they make
That is what I have to do
Be the only kid from high school who is still in love with you
Maybe college won't work out, I can come live at your house
I'm supposed to be at class now but my roommate just passed out

And I cannot get in my room, get all my books and what I need
You're all I need but I am pretty sure your parents will never see
I'll let it be, 'cause it was never meant to be,
I'll let it be, 'cause it was never meant to be

Cause you are water twelve feet deep and I am boots made of concrete
We'll wear cool clothes that show some skin,
Flash a fake, so we'll both get in
Now we're dancing, we're so drunk
We are so cool, we are so punk

And yes, we can keep living like this.
As long as you're here I will live like this.

I got boulders on my shoulders
Collar bones begin to crack
There is very little left of me
And it's never coming back

There are certain things you ask of me
And there are certain things I lack
The beginning, we were winning
Now we're just making a fact

What's it matter anymore?
You believe the lies I tell
There's no meaning to the words
But we still sing these songs well

If we all left it alone
Sure it'd work itself out fine
We keep playing with the numbers
And we are running out of time
We are running, we are running

You're a killer and I'm your best friend
Think it's unfair, your situation
You say I'm changing,
Sorry I didn't know I had to stay the same
Could we talk about this later?
Your voice is driving me—driving me insane

I try to write you poems,
But the words—they don't make sense
My hand tries to grip the pencil,
But the fingers are too tense

And I try to show emotion,
But my eyes won't seem to wet
And I'd love to tell you stories,
But I can't remember how they went

You're a flashlight in a dark room for the loneliest black-out
You were all that we had left after it all was filtered out
Turn you on in a dark room right before we both pass out
Turn you on when I need you, but the batteries ran out
They ran out

You're a werewolf and I'm a full moon
All your very worst enemies be gone soon
I think you're changing
Don't worry, you don't got to stay the same
Can we talk about this later?
Your voice is driving me
Driving me insane [9x]

I think you think I'm someone else
Maybe it's me and you've been myself
And this is only a cry for help
You said watch me fade away.

She's cleaning out the closets
Because there's not much more to keep
Well I am laying on the bathroom floor
I choke myself to sleep.

You can not explain to someone
who will never understand
Because I just jumped out your window
and I can not wait til I land.

I need to stop playing out relationships
inside of my head.
Because every one of my memories
is filled with shit you never even said.

And I fell in love with a girl who I will never see again.
It makes me sad in my head
to think how happy we could have been.

And now it's hard to sing along
when you never knew the words
'cause I swear you're talking lies
and you could swear that I misheard.

And now the ship, it's going down
And I am not sure what to think
Well I am going back to bed
'Cause I refuse to watch her sink.

We'll buy balloons, we'll let them go.
When I get back, I'll let you know
that everything will be the same.
You can't deny what you can't change.

And if you're happy, well then, you're happy.
We could leave it all at that.
Pretend you're happy and I'll be happy.
Then I'll try to make it fact.

Now she's cleaning out the closets
because there's not much more to keep
Well I am laying on the bathroom floor
I choke myself to sleep.

You can not explain to someone
who will never understand
Because I just jumped out your window
and I can't wait til I land.

And now the ship, it's going down
And I am not sure what to think
Well I am going back to bed
'Cause I refuse, I refuse, to watch her sink.

Flying model rockets own the sky in the backyard next to mine
I get these strange phone calls at night with no one on the other side
My brother's friend explains to me with breathless words and bloody knees
It's a black eyed trust, respect with pain.
A love I'll learn when I've been through the same.

But there's nothing in California that you could not learn to hate here
The questions will all still be waiting for you, the answers will only be less clear
It's hard to say what I would do if I was back a year or two
Look at our plans, try to understand what could have happened to all of them.

Flying model rockets own the sky in the backyard next to mine
I get these strange phone calls at night with no one on the other side
My brother's friend explains to me with breathless words and bloody knees
It's a black eyed trust, respect with pain.
A love I'll learn when I've been through the same.

I'll paint my face on the wall in your bedroom.
I would say anything if it would make you happy.
I'm tripping acid while you're tripping mushrooms.
I'm falling through the floors and walking on the ceiling.
I'll paint my face on a wall in your bedroom.
I'm stabbing at the thoughts only to see what's bleeding
While I'm tripping acid and you're tripping mushrooms.
The walls are black and moving, but you tell them I'm happy.

And we both know where this is going to lead to.
Yeah, we both know where this is going to lead to.
And I'd fight your boyfriend if you thought I had to
'Cause we both know where this is going to lead to.

Put your poems inspired by true love
I would say anything if it would make you happy.
I'd sing you songs until you said 'enough'.
I'm falling through the floors and walking on the ceiling.
I'd fight your boyfriend; I would try to be tough.
I'm stabbing at the thoughts only to see whats bleeding
And I'd sing you songs until you said 'enough'.
The walls are black; they're moving in,
But you can tell them I'm happy.

And we both know where this is going to lead to.
Yeah, we both know where this is going to lead to.
And I'd fight your boyfriend if you thought I had to
'Cause we both know where this is going to lead to.

Are you ready? Here we go
How do you feel? Cause I feel fine
Just remember what I said will go better than last time
You can call me when you sober up, let me know you're still alive
We can try again tomorrow, we can start over tonight

I shouldn't feel like I have to protect you
I shouldn't feel like I have to entertain
I shouldn't feel the way I feel
I don't think that anybody else could feel this way
And I'll be fine
Yeah, I'll be alright

Hey, sweetheart, where'd you get those eyes?
Do you think that I could have a pair?
Love the way that they glaze over
No point in pretending that we care
There are cracks between the concrete that we will all fill up with time
If you wanna move ahead, you will have to leave me behind

I shouldn't feel like I have to protect you
I shouldn't feel like I have to entertain
I shouldn't feel the way I feel
I don't think that anybody else could feel this way
And I'll be fine
Yeah, I'll be alright

I watch the corner of a room
As some kid tries to start a fight
His shirt is a little bit too small
Pants a little bit too tight
I watch you try to get involved
Watch you try to make it right
Watch me try to walk away
Watch me leave with you tonight

I shouldn't feel like I have to protect you
I shouldn't feel like I have to entertain
I shouldn't feel the way I feel
I don't think that anybody else could feel this way
And I'll be fine
Yeah, I'll be alright

I've done it before, she don't like it
Just shut all the doors and keep quiet
You think you need more, I'll supply it
You think you need more

I love what we had it got taken away
I love what we had it got taken away
And I won't lie, no, I won't lie

And I keep taking off my clothes
And putting them right back on
'Cause there's decisions to be made
And I won't, I won't play along

I've done it before, she don't like it
Just shut all the doors and keep quiet
I tried to explain, she won't buy it
So, I won't lie to you

It's a bootleg copy of a movie I've already seen
I'll probably leave before the ending
A bootleg copy of a movie I've already seen

And I keep taking off my clothes
And putting them right back on
'Cause there's decisions to be made
And I won't, I won't play along
No, I won't play along.

I've done it before, she don't like it
Just shut all the doors and keep quiet
You think you need more, I'll supply it
And I won't lie

And I keep taking off my clothes
And putting them right back on
'Cause there's decisions to be made
And I won't, I won't play along
No, I won't play along.

If you're uncomfortable, I could take my clothes off too.
We could go back to the party
Or we could stay up in your room.
And I should hug my friends more than I do.
It's unfortunate, my attitude, I need more elbow room.

And when I quit, when it's all over and done with,
You'll be the first person I tell.
It's such a bunch of bullshit, you're such a fucking hypocrite.
You'll be the distance that I fell, the distance that I fell.

I should know more by now, but I'm learning as I go.
I've got so many questions, but if I ask, I'll never know.
And I should wash my hair more than I do.
It's a consequence in a living room from the windows I look through.

When I quit, when it's all over and done with,
You'll be the first person I tell.
It's such a bunch of bullshit, you're such a fucking hypocrite.
You'll be the distance that I fell, the distance that I fell.

When I quit, when it's all over and done with,
You'll be the first person I tell.
It's such a bunch of bullshit; you're such a bunch of hypocrites.

La la la la la la la la la la

Well they tell me drugs don't pay
And they say that there's no use
But I got a couple friends that say that that's not true
And they got wallets full of proof

I needed the money and it was nothing more
Than a little self-centered, self enhated youth
And now I'm in trouble, I'm leaving tomorrow
And I am taking you

La la la la la la la la la la

And I know what he's saying couldn't have been that funny
But you seem to be laughing quite loud
So I will sit and think of reasons that you think that it's funny
But I will probably never figure it out

And you tell me that you're staying
But I know what you say ain't true
And then I thought I'd try to catch you with friction of both our bodies
But then remembered that I was way too smooth

La la la la la la la la la la

The end of the world makes me nervous
'cause I, for one, have not found god yet.
Or someone to fall in love with
Rob a bank, shoot a cop with.

I watched this girl being choked
By a man she hardly knows
In a room full of strangers
That probably don't know her name.

The first time I had sex it was a stranger in a bathroom.
My friends were right, and since that day it felt the same.
I want to go back
To when I laughed
At things I thought were funny.

I like running when it's dark out
And the people in the cars drive fast
'cause they wanna get home.
And their high beams blind me.
It reminds me:
Just bad timing,
Reasons I'm alone.

And it goes
And it goes

At my funeral, don't lie.
Tell them I did not want to die.
At my funeral, don't lie.
Tell 'em I didn't wanna die.
At my funeral, don't lie.
I didn't wanna die.
At my funeral, at my funeral, don't lie.

There are things I wish you'd do more often
Like laugh and talk to me (ha ha ha)
I understand that everybody's got their problems
But you've seem to have a little more than anybody

There are things I think we'll come to regret
And the majority of them are dealing with me
And there are things I know you've come to expect
Bur right now, believe me, believe me, show me some respect

And I know that you know me like nobody else
It's just hard to explain, I like to be by myself
And it's like having a question when no one will help
And you're just one of those books, there's a lot on the shelf
And there are things that we could do to make ourselves stand out
But we won't, no we won't

There are things I wish you wouldn't take from me
Like my cell phone, my wallet, my car keys, and my dignity
I know you think that we've had too much to drink
But I haven't, let it go, let it be, let me enjoy the party

There are things I think we'll come to regret
And the majority of them are dealing with me
And there are things I know you've come to expect
But right now, believe me, believe me, show me some respect

And I know that you know me like nobody else
It's just hard to explain, I like to be by myself
And it's like having a question when no one will help

Staring at unfamiliar ceilings and I should leave
'Cause everybody here is tripping some new drug
except for me (WHY?)
'Cause I don't have the money

I have been thinking about letting my hair grow
I have been thinking about cutting it short
I have been thinking about dying it yellow
But I don't think I have the bone structure or wardrobe to support
That type of look

And I will tattoo my poems all over my body
They won't know who I was before
I will cut off my fingers, no ID to find me
When I am washed up on the New Jersey shore

Talk to myself too often trying hard to figure out
Why all these feelings that lie in my stomach
Are always pushing for my mouth
So I will learn to sleep on my chest
And I will learn to let things go
And I will learn to come to terms with the things that I will never know

And I will tattoo my poems all over my body
They won't know who I was before
I will cut off my fingers, no ID to find me
When I am washed up on the New Jersey shore

I'll take what I can get, I'll take what I am given, but we both know that I'll need more.
I'll take what I can get, I'll take what I am given, but we both know that I'll need more.
So much more.

And I will tattoo my poems all over my body
They won't know who I was before
I will cut off my fingers, no ID to find me
When I am washed up on the New Jersey shore

Well, the sun was made for people who were never gonna touch it
but keep their heads up anyway
And my notebook's filled with stories, some of them have kept their meanings
most of them I've thrown away

And my phone calls with the stranger
And we have nothing in common
And I have nothing to say

Fingertips find the pulse now
As the heart begins to slow down
And a best friend slips away

It used to go question and then answer
But we were younger and it was easy
And now it goes question and then question,
Question, answers don't come so easy
But I am a grown-up, so I should find something to occupy my time
Instead of notebooks filled with nonsense
Looking for answers I'll never find.

Sometimes you talk when you are sleeping about things that have no meaning
but I listen anyway
I have been thinking about leaving, but my best options say to stay
I think I'll lay down in the street and let the cars drag me away
"You know what I mean?" I think you ask me when you're done telling me your story
But I am drunk and I have been ignoring every single word you say.
And now you show me new tattoos as my fingers touch your skin
You say they all have so much meaning, while colored ink is sinking in.

It used to go question and then answer
But we were younger and it was easy
And now it goes question and then question,
Question, answers don't come so easy
But I am a grown-up, so I should find something to occupy my time
Instead of notebooks filled with nonsense
Looking for answers I'll never find.

Please fall asleep so I can take pictures of you and hang them in my room
So when I wake up feel like, "Yeah. Everything's alright."

You are still here, you are still happy
You are still smiling and laughing
You are still the only thing and everything I need in my life

And it goes in in out through the mouth
Breathing exercises
I will never figure out
'Til I am running in circles
Or (I am) walking in circles
Or (I am) crawling in circles
Or lying on the ground

And I can hear your dog whistle from my bedroom
Yeah yeah
And I can see a flashlight cutting up the trees behind my house
(And I can see a flashlight)
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

She says a lot of the kids we graduated with are now homeless
Which puts them in mad shady situations with mad shady people
If not every day then on an every other day basis

And she's probably with a few of them right now
And they are probably just drinking and talking about
How she misses getting fucked up and hanging around

And he says "Hey you're good at that" and she says "Thanks, it's kind of all I got,"
And then she looks away and says "It's also all I need."

And I can smell plastic burning
I can smell chemicals breaking down
I got your last three e-mails
The ones where you said, "I was sorting some things out"

And he will be able to hear her dog whistle from his bedroom
Yeah yeah
And I can see a flashlight cutting up the trees behind my house
(And I can see a flashlight)
Yeah yeah

And I will read the flashing
Like a Morse Code explanation
That will mean nothing but take all night to figure out, out, out

(Please fall asleep so I can take pictures of you and hang them in my room
So when I wake up feel like, "Yeah. Everything's alright.")
When I am sad, I am sad, but when I'm happy, oh God I'm happy
There's just no place in-between for us to meet

(You are still here, you are still happy, you are still smiling and laughing
You are still the only thing and everything I need in my life)
When I am sad, I am sad, but when I'm happy, oh God I am happy
There's just no place in-between for us to meet

There is a map in my room
On the wall of my room
And I've got big big plans.
But I can see them slipping through
Almost feel them slipping through
The palms of my sweaty hands.
And I move slow, just slow enough to make you uncomfortable.

You say I hate you.
You mean it and I love you sounds fake
It's taken me so long to figure that out.
I used to love the taste.
I would do anything for it.
Now I would do anything to get the taste out of my mouth.
And you're so confident but I hear you crying in your sleeping bag.

But you were broken bad yourself
You were mad as hell you felt
If you had done anything with anyone else
It would have worked out so well.

But you are an artist
And your mind don't work the way you want it to.
One day you'll be washing yourself with hand soap in a public bathroom.
And you'll be thinking, "How did I get here?
Where the hell am I?"
If the roles were reversed
You could have seen me sneaking up, sneaking up from behind.

She sees these visions, she feels emotion.
She says that I cannot go
She sees my plane in the ocean.
And what about your friends.
Don't you love them enough to stay?
And I say if I don't leave now then I will never get away.
Let me be a blue raft on a blue sea I'll blend right in.

There is a map in my room
On the wall of my room
I've got big big plans.
But I can see them falling through
Almost feel them slipping through

I love to wait. I love girls with ex boyfriends, that they
Aren't really over
And I love New Mexico, I love places I've never been
I love the idea of places I'll never go

So I'm swinging like a fist fight concrete colored basement
Alright, alright lets keep this clean, as clean as you'd like
And it probably won't get easier, just easier to hide
Prepare for an aching the rest of your life

I'm playing dead. I faked my death and I'll keep pretending
If nothing else for the sake of the tradition
And I am confident
Even if it makes no sense. I will say I love you back
To the love that I am given

So I'm swinging like a fist fight concrete colored basement
Alright, alright lets keep this clean, as clean as you'd like
And it probably won't get easier, just easier to hide
Prepare for an aching the rest of your life

So I'm swinging like a fist fight concrete colored basement
Alright, alright lets keep this clean as clean as you'd like

I am climbing up this mountain so I can ride my skateboard right back down it.
But first I am digging myself out of this hole.
I love your eyes, the way they look when you're uncomfortable.

I bought fireworks, a big bag in Pennsylvania
I'm gonna light 'em up when I get home to Jersey
They'll probably arrest me. It'll probably ruin my whole summer.
Stop taking pictures with your phone. Stop taking pictures with your phone.

The door sounded when she shut it.
As if she didn't really have to leave.
She just needed a separator.
She needed something in between.

I bought fireworks, a big bag in Pennsylvania
I'm gonna light 'em up when I get home to Jersey.
They'll probably arrest me. It'll probably ruin my whole summer.
Stop taking pictures with your phone. Stop taking pictures with your phone.

I wonder how that bike trip's going
I wonder if the government knows he’s hiding
It’d probably take a few more months
Florida’s a long way from Rhode Island

I watch her rest her hands inside her lap
I try to focus hard cause her eyes don’t make the frame
I try to work up the courage to kiss the bottom half of her face
And Mora cut her hair in Baltimore right before I left
I watch her sitting by herself, talking to herself,
Breathing calmly, then try to catch her breath.

Casanova just can’t turn the charm on
Or find any of the right vibrations
I know these women if he don’t wanna do it
Then they are probably just gonna make him
You can never tell when they're fucking around

Everything you’re feeling is common
Even though you never felt so alone
I could probably catch a ride to your house
And borrow a bike to get back home

She says you gotta promise not to break
No matter how far you are bent
She says I gotta shift my position and try to get comfortable again
We both choose the same tone,
mine was an alarm clock ringing from a cell phone
Mouth the words to me so we can keep things quiet
And I’ll still know exactly what you mean.

And it is probably just my friends fucking around.
Yeah, it is probably just my friends fucking around.
They never cut me any slack.
It’s just my friends fucking around.

And it is probably just my friends fucking around.
Yeah, it is probably just my friends fucking around.
They never cut me any slack.
It’s just my friends fucking around.

There's beer in coffee mugs, water bottles and soda cups
And it's clear as the windows I came through
That you are in one of those moods and I am in one of them, too
And it's hard to communicate anything

And I will remember that summer
As the summer I was taking steroids
Because you like a man with muscles
And I like you.

It's the cops are coming in type of sobering up
It's a girl who never learned that I could not give a fuck
My friends are happy, I am happy, I have learned to adapt
It's a darker kind of humor and I can still hear 'em laugh

And there's beer in coffee mugs, water bottles and soda cups
And it's clear as the windows I came through

And I will remember that summer
As the summer I was taking steroids
Because you like a man with muscles
And I like you.

But it's an aerial view from your house to my room
Yeah, it's an aerial view from your house to my room
And I am looking in your windows, and I am trying not to stare
Holding on to hope I'm sure was never even there
'Cause it's an aerial view from your house to my room

As the summer I was taking steroids
As the summer I was taking steroids
As the summer I was taking steroids

I have this dream that I am hitting my dad with a baseball bat
And he is screaming and crying for help
And maybe halfway through it has more to do with me killing him
Than it ever did protecting myself
And I believe that yeah, dad, maybe no one is perfect
But I believe that you are pushing your luck
It just sucks it played out like this
A terrible movie
You can tell none of the actors even give a fuck

But you look good tonight, girlfriend
Can I sleep in your bed
And when I crawl out in the morning
Can I stay inside your head

'Cause you were high school
And I was just more like real life
And you were okay, okay as a girlfriend, girlfriend
But I was just more like his wife
I'll do the pushups
I'll wear the makeup
I'll do whatever he wants all night
'Cause you were okay, okay as a girlfriend, girlfriend
But I was just more like real life

A long, long time ago my great, great, great, great grandfather
Took something that did not belong to him
And that is why today I have an eagle in my veins
I am part Native American
And I am leaving as soon as I come
As soon as I come you will probably forget my name
I hope I fall asleep at the wheel and crash my car (on the way home)
Or I could just stay here, because

You look good tonight girlfriend
Can I sleep in your bed?
And when I crawl out in the morning
Can I stay inside your head?

'Cause you were high school
And I was just more like real life
And you were okay, okay as a girlfriend, girlfriend
But I was just more like his wife
I'll wear the makeup
I'll do the pushups
I'll do whatever he wants all night
'Cause you were okay as a girlfriend
But I was just more like real life

More like real life
More like real life
More like real life

You were high school
And I was just more like real life
And you were okay, okay as a girlfriend, girlfriend
I was just more like his wife
And it is okay
I'll wear the makeup
I'll do whatever you want all night
'Cause you were okay, okay as a girlfriend, girlfriend
But I was just more like real life

More like real life

There's comfort in the bottom of a swimming pool
I'm holding my breath for you
There's no doubt in my mind that if you could then you would try
To crack my ribcage open and pull my heart right through

There's comfort in the bottom of a swimming pool
I'm holding my breath for you
There's no doubt in my mind that if you could then you would try
To crack my ribcage open and pull my heart right through

But I'm a creature of a culture that I create
I'm the last one on the dance floor
As the chandelier gives way
And I am permanently
Preoccupied with your past
I've been around long enough now
To know that the good things never last
They never last

There's comfort in the silence of a living room
The TV is on for you
Hide in your basement while your house burns down
Your teeth are loose inside of your gums
They will eventually fall out
Follow an orange extension cord under a carpet, to a closet door
Feeding the black light that will someday make me very, very, very, very, very rich

But I'm a creature of a culture that I create
And I'm the last one on the dance floor
As the chandelier gives way
And I am permanently
Preoccupied with your past
I've been around long enough now
To know that the good things never last
They never last

How low is your self esteem
And how low could it possibly be?
I know, I know you're in love with me
And I've been ignoring you

I will stop cutting my pants into shorts
I will address the issues I cannot ignore
And I will do the things I think you might like
And I will be alone probably the rest of my life

There's comfort in the bottom of a swimming pool

Foreign countries
Hardwood floors and trying to sleep
Foreign Languages
On all three channels of TV

I don't want no drama or baggage
Don't tell me complicated stories
About who you used to be but are different
And have changed as a person completely

And I am not sure that I want
Any single part of this
Any single part of any of this shit

'Cause everybody pays
Everybody's head is in the noose
You're part of a program
Get with the program

'Cause everybody comes and falls asleep
Lies awake, pretends to be sleeping
You're not even sleeping
You're prob'ly even listening

Keep it simple and honest
Stop crying, you're an adult
I could stand up, I could man up
It's just so convenient to be fragile
This pain is constant and sharp
Watching the signals that you send
I wanna feel lethal on the inside
I wanna read American Psycho again

But I am not sure that I want
Any single part of this
Any single part of any of this shit

'Cause everybody pays
Yeah, everybody's head is in the noose
You're part of a program
Get with the program

'Cause everybody comes and falls asleep
Lies awake, pretends to be sleeping
You're not even sleeping
You're prob'ly even listening
You're not even sleeping
You're prob'ly even listening, even listening

'Cause everybody pays
Yeah, everybody's head is in the noose
You're part of a program
Get with the program

'Cause everybody comes and falls asleep
Lies awake, pretends to be sleeping
You're not even sleeping
You're prob'ly even listening
You're not even sleeping
You're prob'ly even listening, even listening to me

I am washing my hair with soap
I am sitting down in the shower
It is this dirty type of clean
That keeps me trapped in here for hours

Still I scrub and scrub until my body bleeds
Convince myself I am coming clean
Forget and ignore who I used to be
That kid is never coming back

Relax my muscles
And all of a sudden I am scared
All of a sudden I can't breathe
All of a sudden I am nothing
In this moment
You are everything

She says can you feel that?
Oh, what a marvelous sensation
She says could you please take me off speaker phone
This is a private conversation

And I am washing my hair with soap
Yes I am washing my hair with soap
Yes I am washing my hair with soap
Yes I am washing my hair with soap, with soap

But there is air inside of my lungs
And it is keeping me afloat
He says his grandpa's in the mafia
He is the nicest guy I know

So I will run and run
Maybe drive my car
Baby, look at me now, I have come so far
And I don't know where my family's from
But I've got this stereotypical temper
I cannot shake

Relax all the muscles in my face
And all of a sudden I am scared
All of a sudden I can't breathe
All of a sudden I am nothing
In this moment
You are everything

She says can you feel that?
Oh, what a marvelous sensation
She says could you please take me off speaker phone
This is a private conversation

And I am washing my hair with soap
Yes I am washing my hair with soap
Yes I am washing my hair with soap
Yes I am washing my hair with soap, with soap

My head has thoughts
What a ridiculous place to start
She said, well, how about my chest
Or, more specifically, my heart

Whenever I'm alone or feeling lonely
I pretend I can play the drums
Inside my head and I am good
I love these songs
They love my songs

But I am not a dirty god
And I don't have a dirty body
And I am alone only half of the time
The other half I am only hiding
And she was getting high
Yeah, she was smoking pot
I'm pretty sure I am the only guy
She's hooked up with tonight
But probably, no, probably not.

Who did I think I was,
Who did I think that I could be?
Oh, how dare me,
Oh, how dare me.
And there's a voice in the back of my head
In the back of my head, says, "let 'em be.
Just let them be happy."
I'm gonna go crazy

I am the water in a puddle in the shade of a tree
When I freeze over, you are the sun
You cannot touch me
And the tree feels bad
I can tell by the way that it felt
But it still won't move
So, the ice won't melt.
No, it still won't move
So, the ice won't melt.

But I am not a dirty god
I don't have a dirty body
And I am alone only half of the time
The other half I am only hiding

Keep my body alive
Keep my arms reaching out towards anyone

But I am not a dirty god
And I don't have a dirty body
And I am alone only half of the time
The other half I am only hiding
And we were getting high
And I was smoking pot
I'm pretty sure I am the only guy
She's hooked up with tonight
But probably, no, probably not

Come on give me a break, what is the point if I stay,
there’s not that much I can say.
I never really knew your mom anyway.
And now she’s crying in the bathroom.
I’m standing on the back porch for support.
And she is begging you not to cut your hair
cause curly hair don’t look good cut short.

And you have gotta do this now or you can never come home again.
Yeah, you have gotta do this now or you can never come home again...again.

You got a rash on your neck just below the line
where at your shirt stops covering and leaves your skin bare.
It’s such an unimportant detail,
that has nothing to do with anything,
but it's the only thing I remember from when I cut your hair.

And you have gotta do this now or you can never come home again.
Yeah, you have gotta do this now or you can never come home again.
And there are not so many options, there's not so many ways that this could possibly end.
So you have gotta do this now or you can never come home again...again.

You know what I think's really sad
I know how really sad you are
I'm probably gonna leave real soon
Just wanted to let you know
Before I say
Au revoir
Au revoir
You probably don't even know what that means
Au revoir
Au revoir
You probably don't even know what that means

She says that it's French
"I know what it means
You don't have to be so mean
If you wanna leave
Why don't you go"
Right before she walks away
I'm pretty sure I hear her say

"Adios
Adios
I bet you think I don't know what that means
Adios
Adios
I bet you think I don't know what that means"

Rock'n'Roll
Rock'n'Roll
You probably don't understand what I mean
Rock'n'Roll
Rock'n'Roll
You probably don't understand what I mean

Au revoir
Au revoir
You probably don't understand what I mean
Au revoir
Au revoir
You probably don't even know what that means

She says that it's French
I know what it means
Just thought I should let you know
Before I say au revoir

I walk around like a skeleton last night
Trying to find my way home
This white frame it’s all that I’ve got left
Cause not even you could chew through my bones
I’ve got very strong bones

I walk around like a skeleton last night
Confused and alone
Who was I kidding I cant get past you,
You are the cops, you are my student loans
You are a head shaped hole
In a sheet rock wall
You are the pain I feel
You are the stud in the wall
Better than nothing at all

And I got so stoned
I fell asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat
I’m too tall
But I got so stoned
I fell asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat
I’m too tall
But I got so stoned

Come on, baby, calm me down
You’re the only one who knows how

Reunited and it feels so good,
It’s so much better than I thought it would.
Cause I feel fucked, but in a good way.
I start to cough, taste the butane.
And I can tell that he’s asking her Yes or No questions
By the way she’s shaking her head
From left to right, then up and down,
Then left to right again.

I’m gonna go get so stoned
I fall asleep in the front seat.
I never sleep in the front seat,
I’m too tall.
But I got so stoned
I fell asleep in the front seat.
I never sleep in the front seat,
I’m too tall.
But I got so stoned

Come on, baby, calm me down
You’re the only one who knows how

I got miles to go
Till I ever get home
But the sound of your laugh
And your voice on the phone
Makes me feel like I am already there

I got so stoned
I fell asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat
I’m too tall
But I got so stoned
I fell asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat
I’m too tall
But I got so stoned
I fell asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat
I’m too tall
But I got so stoned

Space age crystals
I've been growing 'em since I was a kid
Like my mother plays the lottery
'Til I get rich some other way or she wins it

And there is someone out there just like me probably keeping to themselves
I know CPR, I know mouth-to-mouth
When your legs give in and your lungs give out
I will blow air into your open mouth
Baby, I can spit this game all day

I swear to god the devil made me do it
It's a shame the bad habits are the hardest ones to break
Our love's a dangerous, dangerous game
One that I am definitely losing, cannot walk away

But there is someone out there just like me probably keeping to themselves
I know CPR, I know mouth-to-mouth
When your legs give in and your lungs give out
I will blow air into your open mouth
Baby, I can spit this game all day

I wanna make tear-jerking-shower-curtain-camera's-running genius
I wanna make them think they're seeing something they ain't never seen before
But I am full of shit, I'm a plagiarist
As a liar, I'm a ten
I just want this to mean something to anyone even if they don't know who I am
I am, I am, I am

But I know CPR, I know mouth-to-mouth
When your legs give in and your lungs give out
I will blow air into your open mouth
I know CPR

(Space age crystals)

This is for the lions living in the wiry broke down frames of my friends bodies
When the flood water comes, it ain't gonna be clear. It's gonna look like mud
But I will help you swim
I will help you swim
I'm gonna help you swim

This is for the snakes and the people they bite
For the friends I've made; for the sleepless nights
For the warning signs I've completely ignored
There's an amount to take, reasons to take more
It's no big surprise you turned out this way
When they close their eyes and prayed you would change
And they cut your hair, and sent you away
You stopped by my house the night you escaped
With tears in my eyes, I begged you to stay
You said, "Hey man, I love you but no fucking way"

I'm sure that we could find something for you to do on stage
Maybe shake a tambourine or when I sing, you sing harmonies

This is for the lake that me and my friends swim in, naked and dumb on a drunken night
And it should've felt good but I can hear the Jaws theme song on repeat in the back of my mind
Make sure you kiss your knuckles before you punch me in the face
There are lessons to be learned, consequences for all the stupid things I say
And it is no big surprise you turned out this way
The spark in your eyes, The look on your face
I will not be late

I'm sure we could find something for you to do on stage
Maybe shake a tambourine or when I sing you sing harmonies

I wanna contribute to the chaos
I don't wanna watch and then complain
'Cause I am through finding blame
That is the decision that I have made

She hopes I'm cursed forever to
Sleep on a twin-sized mattress
In somebody's attic or basement my whole life
Never graduating up in size to add another
And my nightmares will have nightmares every night
Oh, every night. Every night

You are my peach, you are my plum
You are my earth, you are my sun
I love your fingers, I love your toes
The back of your head, the tip of your nose

And you are the reason I'm smiling when there is nothing to smile about
Yeah, you are the reason I'm smiling when there is nothing to smile about

One day you will find someone who will love you like you deserve
But tonight I'm the only one left and I'm betting it's a fact that you will never learn
Once I sink my teeth, your skin's not so tough
I'll leave a tiny cut, there will be a lot of blood
But once you wipe it up you will feel better about our entire situation

You are my light, no need to hide
You are my clock, keep me on time
You are my angel, you are my crime
I'll serve this sentence the rest of my life

And you are the reason I'm smiling when there is nothing to smile about
Yeah, you are the reason I'm smiling when there is nothing to smile about
I do things wrong, you thought I might
You say I'm gonna miss you when you leave and you are probably right
But I'm just as stoned, I don't wanna fight
You say I should think before I talk, you say I shouldn't think about my life
Cause once I finally hit the ground, who's gonna drag me into the light?
It's just so hard to see tomorrow past tonight, woah
It's just so hard to see tomorrow past tonight, woah


Sometimes I cry when I get sad
I guess it's true what they say
Emotional baby boy, emotional man
Emotional baby boy, emotional man, emotional man, emotional man
I am emotional

I wish we were forever lying on the Santa Monica beach
Drinking Tecate 24oz underneath the stars
Being the superior couple, loving who I am cause what we are
I wanna confess it in a whisper that's just loud enough to make out
I want you to listen from the kitchen to me confessing on the couch
I wanna be stronger than your dad was for your mom
I wanna be stronger than your dad was for your mom

Where I'm standing there is a cool, cool breeze
Heavenly bodies make the devil a little uncomfortable
I guess there are some things I was just born to be
Emotional baby boy, emotional man
Emotional baby boy, emotional man, emotional man, emotional man
I am emotional

It's such a big city
I feel so stupid thinking I might see you if I wander around
If I do the things we used to do together and we were on the same level
You'd be doing them as well
There's something about drowning I can't shake
Or someone dying anyway

I wanna confess it in a whisper that's just loud enough to make out
I want you to listen from the kitchen to me confessing on the couch
I wanna be stronger than your dad was for your mom
I wanna be stronger than your dad was for your mom

From where I'm standing there is a cool, cool breeze
From where I'm standing there is a cool, cool breeze

Emotional baby boy, emotional man
Emotional baby boy, emotional man, emotional man, emotional man

I was so bored before I met you
But then I met you and everything changed
And now it seems I could be amused at the littlest things
If I told my truth

She says you, you should admit it
She know I, I probably won't
That he's the sound you want now
And I’m just the noise you don't
And I’m just saying it's a bummer, man
I’m sorry for interrupting
I guess I’ll go

You were my girl you were my baby
You were my homemade mashed potatoes, biscuits, and gravy
You were too good, I should have known
You were a prize my hands could never hold

She says you, you should admit it
She know I, I probably won't
That he is the sound you want now
And I, I’m just the noise you don't
And I’m just saying it's a bummer, man
I’m sorry for interrupting
I guess I’ll go

And she says “tell me what I need to hear, what I wanna hear or else”
I call her baby, I ask her to sit down,
Ask her to sit down and allow me to try to explain myself

She says you, you, you
You should probably admit it, probably admit it
but I, I, I, I, I probably won't, probably won't, probably won't
That he, he, he, he's the sound you want now, the sound you want now
And I, I, I, I’m the noise you don't, the noise you don't
I, I, I, I should probably admit it, probably admit it
but I, I, I, I, I probably won't, probably won't, probably won't
That he, he, he, he's the sound you want now, the sound you want now
And I, I, I, I’m the noise you don't, the noise you don't

And I’m just saying it's a bummer, man
I’m sorry for interrupting
I guess I’ll go
I guess I’ll go
I guess I’ll go

The good thing about this cast is I can still hold a knife
So if you ever twist my arm again I'll be sure to put up a fight
You see I just don't wanna do the things that you want me to do
But I'm a sucker, so I do them cause I am still in love with you

She said
"Honey, y'gotta learn that love is simple just like mud.
If you play the dirt, then I'll play the water. All we gotta do is touch"

Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anything
But I'm older now and know that I should
Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anything
But I'm older now and know that I should

And it's freezing
And I am watching you shovel snow off a driveway
Across from my parent's home
Now it's summer (now it's summer)
And you are laying out on your lawn
You look so sexy, Chelsea, with your polka dot bikini on

Come on, Chelsea, speak a little French to me
Heard you spent two whole semesters drinking wine
While I was stuck in Jersey trying to save some money
I guess I'm just another thing you left behind

But you were young, you thought you didn't have to care about anyone
But you're older now and wish that you could
Cause you were young, you thought you didn't have to care about anyone
But you're older now and know that you should

It's funny you should ask
Cause I don't remember
It's funny you should ask
I coulda been a contender

1, 2, 3! Everyone say cheese!
Thought you got the best of me
Turns out it was a video
Me and my best friend, me and my cousins
Sitting there smiling
Turns out it was a video

But I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anyone
But I'm older now and know that I should
Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anyone
But I'm older now and know that I should

It's funny you should ask
Cause I don't remember
It's funny you should ask
I coulda been a contender
It's funny you should ask
No I will not surrender
It's funny you should ask
Cause I don't remember

You should know
That you don't kick if you don't have to.
All's fair in love and war,
I know. Don't get me wrong.

But if you listen to your heart,
It may mislead you.
Lord, I should know.
I have felt lost for so long.

You had me go from what I thought was sliding carefully to seriously slipping out of control.

And I'm gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient.
I'm gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient.

It's not like a movie when we kiss.
There'll never be no music when we kiss.
And I'm gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient, convenient, oh, convenient.

I hear her whisper,
"All I want is to want nothing."
The room is dark,
And I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm asleep.

She says, "It just don't make no sense.
Why can't it work out in my head?
Why I can't be happy?
There's definitely reasons I should be."

She says, "And I, for one, will not be held
Responsible for someone else.
I gotta go."

I'm gonna have to learn
This love will never be convenient.
And I'm gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient, convenient, oh, convenient.

Let's talk about how it fell on my shoulders as it came pouring out my ears.
Let's talk about the face of our love and how it might look with the addition of tattooed tears.

Let's talk about the torn-up skin on my fingers right where it meets my fingernails.
Let's talk about how what you call sliding carefully is seriously slipping out of control.

I'm gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient.
I'm gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient.

It's not like a movie when we kiss.
There'll never be no music when we kiss.
And I'm gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient, convenient, oh, convenient.

Goodbye future, once so bright, meet my pregnant girlfriend
Watch my bank account run dry, 437 dollars spent
To put things back to the way they used to be
Still, I woulda spent so much more
But 437 dollars somehow shakes all responsibility
But it's not easy

She looks me dead in the eyes and says "hey Brian
If you still believe in the Lord above,
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us

The past few months were pretty rough
A couple times, wished we both were dead
I never cried like that before,
I thought my eyes would pop out of my head
Not just preparing for nightmares
Years and years I do suppose
Nothing feels alright now
The length of my hair or the fit of my clothes
I'm crying like a baby, soft and nothing

'Cause I can leave so what now what, so where do I go
'Cause I could imagine myself throwing all my clothes
Inside a suitcase without bothering to fold them
'Cause I could imagine myself throwing all my things
Inside a suitcase without bothering to fold them

She looked me dead in the eyes and says "hey Brian
If you still believe in the Lord above,
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us

Because freshness is expected from any hip hop artist,
I avoid using traditional techniques
Techniques
Techniques, Techniques, Techniques, Techniques
Techniques

I don't see me mad at situations, I see me turn and walk away
I see a tattoo on my right thigh that I will probably regret one day
Yeah, I will probably regret one day
But now, I am happy to be bonding in a kitchen with my friends
A spool of thread, a few more good vibes, a safety pin and a ballpoint pen
A safety pin and a ballpoint pen
A safety pin and a ballpoint pen
And a ballpoint pen

But there are answers here, they're just harder to figure out
Since all your questions got harder to dodge and dip around
And there is nothing wrong with my lifestyle
No matter how many times I tell myself to breathe in, hold it, hold it, now let it out, now let it out

One day I will realize I don't need this because it is just not who I am
Until that day comes, I'll keep my eyes closed, and I will try to feel all of the effects
Yeah, I will try to feel all of the effects
And now I am talking way too fast and a little bit louder than I should,
Trying to say thank you for understanding my side of the story the best that you could
My side of the story the best that you could
My side of the story the best that you could
The best that you could

But there are answers here, they're just harder to figure out
Since all your questions got harder to dodge and dip around
And there is nothing wrong with your lifestyle
No matter how many times they tell themselves just breathe in, hold it, hold it, now let it out

And this is how the cool boyfriend sits in the passenger seat of his girlfriend's car
He's lookin' at me, I wish the light would turn green, set me free, oh set me free, oh set me
Teach my rolling veins where there's a will, there is a way
Just cut me open, let me drain, oh let me drain, oh let me drain, oh let me

I'll move to Florida, and I'll buy a brand new pick-up truck
And I'll tint all the windows including the driver's side
Now you can't see me, so you can't touch me
When I sit at the red light and watch your boyfriend wonder if I'm inside
If I am dead inside

Sometimes you get sad when we're together
Because you're not sure if you'll miss me when I'm gone
Just try to appreciate what you got while you got it
So if it ever goes away, you can say you enjoyed it while it lasted
Sometimes I don't feel like singing, I don't really like these songs
Sometimes I don't feel like dancing, DJ please don't turn the beat on
Let's keep it quiet, keep me honest, keep me true
Keep me in love; keep me believing it's with you

But who's gonna push my wheelchair around when I get sick?
God forbid I ever stop feeling sorry for myself, for being selfish
This is not the way I plan on living for the rest of my life
But for right now, it gets me by, it gets me by

It's reached the point in the night where I need to decide
Whether I'm gonna fall asleep or watch the sunrise
We are both into letting this develop
But the thought of starting over always sounded so much better
But I won't stop this, and you won't stop this
It'll probably go further than either of us wanted
And it all comes down to the fact that I don't care to
Sacrifice a good time 'cause someone says I have to
Next thing that I know, I am removing all my clothes
And you are dancing around the room to some song on the radio
You say I deserve it, all that is coming, the good and the bad bad, bad bad
I don't regret it, how could I? You were the best I ever had
I ever had, I ever had, I ever had, I ever

But who's gonna push my wheelchair around when I get sick?
God forbid I ever stop feeling sorry for myself, for being selfish
This is not the way I plan on living for the rest of my life
But for right now, it gets me by, it gets me by

Awkward situations followed by awkward hugs
And these bullshit conversations take what little air is left inside my
Nothing but I'm writing like I've had too much to drink
Letting go of what we lost
Come to terms of how you think of me

And I love what you've done, you cut all ties
You turned and run
You build me up, you take your fall
You led us straight into a wall

And I'll say, "I personally think it's too cold to have the windows open,
but you want to smoke your menthol cigarettes."

You might be leading now but there is no way you could ever win
When you have absolutely no control over any of the situations
That you put yourself in

And I wish I could pretend to be
All of the things you think you see in me
But I am not that guy, that guy just left
He had his collar up and there was smoke on his breath

And we have these parties for the way it was
But once the booze is gone, is it worth the buzz?
Because I've got some problems and I'm talking loud
And all your friends are here so word will get out that

I personally think it's too cold to have the window open
But you want to smoke your menthol cigarettes

And I personally think it's too cold to have the window open
But you want to smoke your menthol cigarettes.

Riding a motorcycle and being in a gang
Being in love and woman's rights and male hedonism
Worshiping the devil, good vibes all around
And acting cool and acting cool and acting cool and acting cool
And acting cool and acting cooooooooool

Sometimes you gotta close your eyes to truly see the light
And most of us are older now, we should know wrong from right
You and me, me and you, loving each other the way that we do

It changed my life - I was gasping for air
I was leaning forward, almost fell out of my chair
And now you're all looking suspicious asking if that's all true
Come on people would I lie to you
Come on people would I lie to you
Would I lie to you
It's just that…

Sometimes you gotta close your eyes to truly see the light
And most of us are older now we should know wrong from right
You and me, me and you - loving each other the way that we do

More like a couple of nights ago
Said nobody knows
So I'm safe but not for long
Go back a couple nights ago
Play the usual so I feel safe to sing along

More like a couple of nights ago
Couple of nights ago

Sometimes you gotta close your eyes to truly see the light
And most of us are older now we should know wrong from right
You and me, me and you - loving each other the way that we do

Sometimes you gotta close your eyes to truly see the light
And most of us are older now, we should know wrong from right
You and me, me and you - loving each other the way that we do

You caught me doing push-ups in the morning before everyone else woke up
And then the c-dog busted in he was out all night getting chased by cops
And in this moment, I was pretty pleased with the person I was pretending to be

I got them bad boy blues, baby
I got them bad boy blues, baby

When she asks me why they call me Brian instead of Steven
I tell her it's got as much to do with personal as it does professional reasons
I got a whole list of reasons I should stop before I start
But the only thing stronger then my head is my heart

I got them bad boy blues, baby
(I got them bad boy blues, baby)
I got them bad boy blues
I feel hypnotized by the way you move
And those big brown eyes

Yeah, that would be great
That would be beach house living
Every night, rest of our lives, you and me
We could go swimming, swimming
Yeah, that would be great
That would be beach house living
Every night, rest of our lives, you and me
We could go swimming, swimming

I got them bad boy blues, baby
(I got them bad boy blues, baby)
I got them bad boy blues
I feel hypnotized by the way you move
And those big brown eyes

Yea, that would be great
That would be beach house living
Every night, rest of our lives, you and me
We could go swimming, swimming

(I got them bad boy blues, baby)
Yea, that would be great
That would be beach house living
Every night, rest of our lives, you and me
We could go swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming
Swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming
Swimming I got them bad boy blues baby

It's snowing right now I wish it was summer
But when the summer rolls around I'll wish I was freezing
They don't call me Mr. Greenside for no reason
When they do I pause and cough it out
I cough it out, I cough it out, I cough it out
I cough it out

All the branches on the tree
That we carved our initials in seem to bend and take the shape of them
And ohhhhhh can't you see
I am delusional with love, I am delusional with love, I am delusional with love

I don't care if you're not sorry I forgive you
And with or without your support I will continue
What I'm trying to say is you never know what you've been through
Till you pause and cough it out
I cough it out, I cough it out, I cough it out
I cough it out

All the branches on the tree
That we carved our initials in seem to bend and take the shape of them
And ohhhhhh can't you see
I am delusional with love, I am delusional with love, I am delusional with love
I am delusional with love, I am delusional with love, I am delusional with love

Whatever I did for you last year I cannot do again
It's getting harder and harder and harder and harder for me to call you friend
No matter how many times I say I won't I'll defend you if I can
But whatever I did for you last year I cannot do again

I like the in-betweens I like the time it takes to get somewhere
If you know what I mean
Wave your hands in the air like you just don't care
I just don't care
I just don't care
I just don't care
I just don't care
I just don't care

All the branches on the tree
That we carved our initials in seem to bend and take the shape of them
And ohhhhhh can't you see
I am delusional with love, I am delusional with love, I am delusional with love

But whatever I did for you last year
I cannot do again
I will not do again

Some of us go through some changes
Some of us go through some phases
Things we fall into
And then fall out
You'd explain this to yourself in the bathroom mirror last night
As you take your toothbrush out of your mouth

You say "This is what I want, motherfucker make it happen for me"
You say "This is what I want, motherfucker make it happen for me"

Help
You are the poison I need
Help
Less of inside my body
Help
You need a means to an ending
I need a spiritual cleansing

When you ask me "Do you wanna stay?" believe me
What I wanna say is "Yes" but I gotta go to work

Help
You are the poison I need
Help
Less of inside my body
Help
You need a means to an ending
And I need a spiritual cleansing

On some nights there's something cool to do
On some nights there is nothing to do at all
I guess it's cool for right now
Just like everything else

I watched her throw her hands up into the air
I hear her say "Don't worry"
The lovers will go down together into the flames with nothing else
But the promise to meet up and hang out

To hang out. Oh, I wanna hang out

Thank you for letting me borrow your jacket
It kept me warm in a cold place
Some people no matter how much money they make
Can't get out of their own way

Thank you for letting me borrow your jacket
It kept me warm in a cold place
Some people no matter how much money they make
Can't get out of their own way

So (Help)
I'm always focusing in on the wrong things (Help)
And then the wrong things become everything (help)
I don't know what I'm gonna do, I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything (Help)

(This is what I want, motherfucker make it happen for me)
(Help)

You are the poison I need (Help)
(This is what I want, motherfucker make it happen for me)
You need a means to an ending (Help)

I don't know anything (Help)
I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything (Help)
I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything

I guess I just don't get your plan
Are you trying to smash my world up
I'm just trying to understand
You say you know me not truly who I am
You stress the modifier while I stress the adjective

But you're in your car
And I'm on my motorcycle
I lay on the floor
Naturally bite your ankles

I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind
I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind

It's like the blind leading the blind
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine sometimes you gotta close your eyes if you wanna see the light
It's not my style to be strong
Strong enough to wanna fight
Fight that I would probably lose but in the end
I would survive
I would survive

I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind
I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind

Ladies and gentlemen
The DJ just threw up
On the dance floor
Party is over,
It's time to go
It's time to go

You were thinking about leaving
You were thinking about walking away
The whole time sleeping
In the chair right next to me

I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind
I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind

But you're in your car
And I'm on my motorcycle
I lay on the floor
Naturally bite your ankles

Ladies and gentlemen
The DJ just threw up
On the dance floor
Party is over
It's time to go

Just you and me
Getting high and hanging out
Getting high and messing around
Getting high and trying to figure it out

There was a sacrificial ritual inside my room last night
Was held there in secret hard to see anything in the candle light
Now there is melted wax all over my floor
And the scent of incense is rising up from underneath the door

Now maybe it was not as serious as I am making it sound

Just you and me
Getting high and hanging out
Getting high and messing around
Getting high, trying to figure it out

I feel the burn my tired feet
Not much to go a few more streets
See your face is all I need
My one and only, my sweet relief
And you would think I never had it
The way that this world likes my magic
But it was all for you
To continue to be able
To continue to be able
Right now

Cause you and me
Getting high and hanging out
Getting high and messing around
Getting high, trying to figure it out
I don't need your (getting high) reasons anymore
(And messing around) I don't need your reasons anymore
I don't need your reasons anymore

I put my wrong finger in the hot wax
Now I can't play for you like that
The last thing I need is truly
The stupid excuse for a reason to fight back
I can't begin
Begin to tell you
The way it all felt
When everything fell through

You moved to New York to meet a beautiful girl
And drink fancy cocktails without a care in the world
But you got scared they're all gonna find someone else
So you find one and tell her things you're dying to tell
We got (high as hell) to a record, how did I forget how it went
It was a song about love and at the time it made sense
When the side ended we just laid there in bed
You had fallen asleep but I stayed up and read
I made a list of everything I said I never meant
Considered all the things I never said but I digress
I got dressed kissed your forehead and left
You called me when you woke but I was sleeping off the meds

I fuckin' hate the comments
Why do you feel you have to talk
Nobody asked for your opinion
Your sick sad way of jerkin' off
Every one you think you're better than
What the fuck I'm guilty too
Half the time that I'm complaining
I'm just talking shit on you (I'm sorry)

Never underestimate
Poor, hungry and desperate
My body is a temple
How much you think I could get for it?
And I will take cold showers from now on until I learn
That once you fuck the fire all that's left to do is burn
Baby, burn, baby, burn

I could feel myself falling from an aeroplane
I hear static when I close my eyes
I imagine one day things settling
And I think about what that might be like

When my mind is uncertain my body decides
'Cause I love you, I miss you, I wanna hug and kiss you
(What it will do, to get through the hell of life)
Oh, I love you, I miss you, I wanna hug and kiss you
(As I trip on the ocean that leads through your eyes)
(it's alright)

I want world domination just like everybody else
So if you hear me talking strategy it's only to myself
Everybody's gotta have a game plan cut it up a couple different ways
Just hope no one remembers these the darkest of my days

When my mind is uncertain my body decides [8x]

Ginger's sleeping on the floor
Of a hard wood floor apartment
Maybe one day she'll have more to say
But right now she has no comment

Everything's a cavity
The last few months especially
But all of that's behind her now
Oh yeah, Oh yeah so you can tie her up
But don't tie her down
Yeah you can tie her up
Don't tie her down

Back before I got struck by lightning
Things were so much different than they are now
I got a lot more people leaning on me and
All I wanna do is make them proud

But this is my body
The only thing that I own entirely
And it will carry me to greatness somehow
Oh yeah, Oh yeah so you can tie me up
But don't tie me down
Yeah you can tie me up
Don't tie me down
Don't tie me down

Every spider I kill
Stays inside of my pocket
I am so desperate to tame the beast
I shut the door and I lock it
I got a dead spider in my pocket
I'm not ashamed to say I was
Desperate to tame the beast
Desperate to tame the beast

See you can tie me up (You can tie me up)
But don't tie me down (Don't tie me down)
Yeah you can tie me up (You can tie me up)
But don't tie me down (Don't tie me down)

Cause everything's a cavity
The last few three months especially
But all of that's behind her now
Oh yeah, Oh yeah so you can tie me up
Don't tie me down
Yeah you can tie her up
Don't tie her down

With you on top of me
And me underneath you
I bet we go 100 miles an hour
Through the ceiling
Cause I am numb, I am numb to the feeling
Looking for that sexual healing

‘Cause our love's the only thing that could matter
Take me up and up and up like a ladder
Our love's the only thing that could matter
Take me up and up like a ladder

Yeah, maybe that could be my thing
What do you think?
I'm talking to young lovers and half price drinks….
I could fight the rain clouds in your life
Every day, every night

Smashing bottles and stepping on glass
Has never felt so good in the past
I'm only human with my flaws
Just a fool with without a cause
With you grinding on me
And me grinding back on you
I bet we were beautiful
Slip sliding on the dance floor

‘Cause our loves the only thing that could matter
Take me up and up and up like a ladder
Our love's the only thing that could matter
Take me up and up like a ladder

Yeah, maybe that could be our thing
What do you think?
I'm talking to young lovers and half price drinks….
I could fight the rain clouds in your life
Every day, every night

Yeah, maybe that could be our thing
What do you think?
I'm talking to young lovers and half price drinks….
I could fight the rain clouds in your life
Every day, every night

‘Cause our love's the only thing that could matter
Take me up and up like a ladder

Yeah, maybe that could be our thing
What do you think?
I'm talking to young lovers and half price drinks….
I could fight the rain clouds in your life
Every day, every night

Yeah, maybe that could be our thing
What do you think?
I'm talking to young lovers and half price drinks….
I could be the rainbow in your sky
Shooting stars above you every night

“Is it raining where you are?”
The only thing I could think to ask
But nothing ever hurt so bad
As the “no” that you said back
But ain't that the truth, man
Those are just facts
The farther you go from where you start
The harder it is to get back

Love of my life, gone forever
Love of my life, gone for good

This is for all my friends in West Virginia

The good stuff comes
The good stuff goes
The good stuff seems so hard to hold
Hope it slides slowly down your throat
So the taste of it may linger
Right now, I'm just a volcano
On the brink of eruption
Right now I'm just a psycho
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction

Love of my life, gone forever
Love of my life, gone for good

I wish I may, I wish I might
One day live life like a person in paradise
Right now, I'm just a volcano
On the brink of eruption
Right now I'm just a psycho
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction
Hell bent on self-destruction

Ride or die
Brothers for life
Darkest days
Coldest nights
Ride or die
Brothers for life
Darkest days
Coldest nights
There ain't no doctor on earth
There ain't no lord up above
Who knows a strong enough medicine
Or a lifesaving love

Like I said, I thought I was focused
I thought I had it figured out
How to organize my words good
Before they fall right out my mouth
But I have learned that the direction
I was walking was so wrong
And I just need a little help here, man
To find the path I should be on

Love of my life, gone forever
Love of my life, gone for good
Love of my life, gone forever
Get her back, good lord you know I wish I could

Should I go in it's been an hour
I give a fake name and hang in the emergency room
They say the good thing plastic flowers is
You can spray them with any type of perfume

You should fear what you already know
And hope that you never find out
About the things you don't know yet
Cause I believe that someone's got a plan for me
Got a plan for me even if I don't know it yet
Not quite yet

You should fear a hurt that's hard to explain
And hope that the next couple days to come
Are as relaxing as any other day
I hope your quarters go to laundry
I hope your problems go away
Either buried underground or drifted off in to space
What more can I say

Cause we are all eventually
Either the victims or the victim's family
The victim's family
The victim's family

[Spoken word:]
Okay, everyone shut the fuck up a minute
I have something to say
Listen just because something burns bright
Doesn't mean it's going to burn forever
So all these people around you saying
You've got so much further to go
It's going to get worse before it gets better
I don't know, I don't if that true
You know, Thanks so much for coming
On this next part let's all sing it together

I believe that someone's got a plan for me
They got a plan for me
Even if I don't know it yet

I believe that someone, somewhere's got a plan for me
They got a plan for me
Even if I don't know it yet

Cause we are all eventually
Either the victims or the victim's family
The victim's family
The victim's family
The victim's family

Do you think my eyes should be wider?
Do you think my expressions should match
How it is on the inside, to say
Do you think my words should be wiser?
Do you think my expressions should match
How it is on the inside, to say

Holy fuck, I'm about to die
Angry for no reason, twisted up inside
You used to say

You used to say, "Don't be angry"
I finally understand why
Everything that you taught me
Got twisted up, on the inside
Wicked roots that take me under
Are twisted up on the inside

Holy fuck, I'm about to die
Angry for no reason, twisted up inside
Holy fuck, I'm about to die
Holy fuck, I'm about to die
You used to say

Holy fuck, I'm about to die

You remind me of a song
Got it on an old cassette
Sounded like an angel singing
About a pain in her chest

But she sees the future
In mysterious ways
She started talking backwards
But nothing good it brings her
So next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign, middle finger

People gathered around
Filled up auditorium
They wanna hear you sing your song
You sound like an angel from above

But she sees the future
In mysterious ways
She started talking backwards
But nothing good it brings her
So next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign, middle finger
Peace sign, middle finger
Peace sign, middle finger
The next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign, middle finger

She can't calm down
I don't know why
We can calm down
I don't know why
It'll be peace sign, middle finger
It'll be peace sign, middle finger

We can calm down
I don't know why
She can't calm down
I don't know why

She started talking backwards
But nothing good it brings her
So next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign, middle finger
Peace sign, middle finger
Peace sign, middle finger
The next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign, middle finger

The next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign middle finger

When you realize the crew you roll with
Is actually what makes you anxious
When you realize the hand you hold with
Is opposite the hand it's supposed to be

Bae, bae, bae, bae

I gotta move my car, I gotta move your couch
I learned that love tastes good, you shoved it in my mouth
I got all twisted up, you helped straighten me out
I gotta wake up early, I gotta move your couch

There's people right outside my door
I wanna help them but I don't know what they're looking for
They've been in and out here all day
Grind my teeth as a dog pushes up against my leg

Leg, leg, leg, leg

I gotta move my car, I gotta move your couch
I learned that love tastes good, you shoved it in my mouth
I got all twisted up, you helped straighten me out
I gotta wake up early, I gotta move your couch

I gotta move my car, I gotta move your couch
I learned that love tastes good, you shoved it in my mouth
I got all twisted up, you helped straighten me out
I gotta wake up early, I gotta move your couch

When you realize the crew you roll with
Is actually what makes you nervous

I wanna be that comfortable place where you write and read
Watch TV or deeply breathe
Back to back you and me feel trapped, never defend only attack
You be Rachel and I'll be bong rips, we'll get high all day

I miss the hours in the morning and you in the morning hours
I miss walking naked through the backyard to get to the outdoor shower
I miss the way things used to be, I miss the way things used to be
It's okay no one's around, I'm off season vacation town

I wanna see everything, lay it all out for me
Feel the breeze with all the windows open in a one star hotel room
But I can only express my love when I'm fucked up or far, far away
Physically another continent emotionally another head space, mentally I'm not even here

I miss the hours in the morning and you in the morning hours
I miss walking naked through the backyard to get to the outdoor shower
I miss the way things used to be, I miss the way things used to be
It's okay no one's around, I'm off season vacation town

Vacation

I wanna be that comfortable place where you write and read
Watch TV or deeply breathe

I miss the hours in the morning and you in the morning hours
I miss walking naked through the backyard to get to the outdoor shower
I miss the way things used to be, I miss the way things used to be
It's okay no one's around, I'm off season vacation town

Tommy I love you!
I confess!
Are you impressed
With what I profess?

A temple of daddy (temple of daddy!)
I had an awakening (had an awakening!)
You never miss the things you had
If you don't want the things you've taken
I grew a gap between my teeth
I grew a crack where I was standing

So fill up the space that I don't need
Feel most complete when we're asleep
My head even with your hips
I hug your knees
Who's to blame, I don't know
I feel no responsibility, though
I feel no responsibility, no

I grew a gap between my teeth
I grew a crack where I was standing
You never wanted to have kids
You never wanted to get married
But "C'est la vie!", Tommy told me
That "It hurts but it's good!
No matter how bad, it's always good!"

So fill up the space that I don't need
Feel most complete when we're asleep
My head even with your hips
I hug your knees
Who's to blame, I don't know
I feel no responsibility, though
I feel no responsibility, no

So fill up the space that I don't need
Feel most complete when we're asleep
My head even with your hips
I hug your knees
Who's to blame, I don't know
I feel no responsibility
So fill up the space that I don't need
Feel most complete when we're asleep
My head even with your hips
I hug your knees
Who's to blame, I don't know
I feel no responsibility, though
I feel no responsibility, no
Oh-oh

Encore, night is almost over
I'm bored, wanna leave
It felt good before but now it's getting older
'Cause there's no more empathy

Final firework of summer, your phone falls into the fire
It's the last act of a dying cellphone
Last call of a desperate man

Empty wine bottles in my room
When I wake up I think of you
It's our grand finale

Drugstore, twenty-four hour market
We'll go before we see

Final firework of summer, your phone falls into the fire
It's the last act of a dying cellphone
Last call of a desperate man

Empty wine bottles in my room
When I wake up I think of you
It's our grand finale

Empty wine bottles in my room
When I wake up I think of you
It's our grand finale

It's the last act of a dying cellphone
Last call of a desperate man
A strange sense of relief
Strange sense of relief

Empty wine bottles in my room
When I wake up I think of you
It's our grand finale

Empty wine bottles in my room
When I wake up I think of you
It's our grand finale

Like a rat out of hell, I'm crawling
In search of a better space
I desire to get higher
But the world is a flustering place

Come down you can't and you don't know why
You're scared, you choked me for real this time
My eyes roll back and I came with you
Our love was a trap and we both fell through

You and me
Backyard to backyard
Trampoline
To trampoline

Sometimes
When we're together
We're not together
And sometimes
I try to fake it
But you know me better

Come down I can't and I don't know why
I'm scared, you cracked me for real this time
'Til you said "It's fine, I'm fine, it's fine"
It's fine, I'm fine, it's fine

You and me
Backyard to backyard
Trampoline
To trampoline

Sometimes
When we're together
We're not together
And sometimes
I try to fake it
But you know me better

You and me
Backyard to backyard
Trampoline
To trampoline

Sometimes
When we're together
We're not together
And sometimes
I try to fake it
But you know me better

Sometimes
When we're together
We're not together
And sometimes
I try to fake it
But you know me better

It was raining when they let me out of the hospital
I had nothing in my pockets
Still had the bracelet on
Still had the bracelet on, oh yeah
You and me get the chills at the same time
Who would have thought?
The exact vibrations

On the outside I was fine
But inside I was all torn up, yeah
How do you think that felt?
How do you think that felt for me? Yeah

Tracy, or should I call you AnnMarie?
We went flying over all the trees
To see a house built by a mafia member
How do you think that felt?
How do you think that felt for me? Yeah
How do you think that felt?
How do you think that felt for me?
On the outside I was fine
But inside I was all torn up

'Cause I feel absolute fantastic
To fall asleep would take some magic
To fall asleep would take some magic
'Cause I feel absolute fantastic
How do you think that felt?
How do you think that felt for me? Yeah
How do you think that felt?
How do you think that felt for me? Yeah

How do you think that felt?
How do you think that felt for me? Yeah
How do you think that felt?
How do you think that felt for me? Yeah
How do you think that felt?
How do you think that felt for me? Yeah
How do you think that felt?
How do you think that felt for me? Yeah


All the back and forth will make you numb
'Til you're fine with it
If you wanna sell your watch and drink all day
I'm fine with it
Pushed over the edge
It was a passionate rage
I was talking so fast
Never could explain

Far drive
Totally worth it
Just to see you
Act alive
Far drive
Act alive

You take pictures of everything (Uh-huh)
So afraid of remembering
"Hi I'm Marth, from Hell
All of the flutter
I got diamond-dust shoes on my feet
I got New Orleans blood in me"

It's a far drive
Totally worth it
Just to see you
Act alive
Plus being
In the car with
People you love is
Always a good time

Far drive
Totally worth it
Just to see you
Act alive
Plus being
In the car with
People you love is
Always a good time
People you love is
Always a good time

For miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
For miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
For miles and miles and miles and miles and miles (Far drive)
For miles and miles and miles and miles and miles

Got into a bit of a state last night
Deleted every contact in my life
Built a fire in my mind, went back inside

The consequence is coming
I still have yet to learn
That every little bit
Helps the fire burn

It doesn't get worse, it doesn't get better
You just get old, it lasts forever

Can't get happy, can't get sad
It's hard to do

When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you
It's hard to do
When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you

I fell in love
'Cause no one saw me the way you did
And no one's seen me that way since
But for a short time that's how I lived

Can't get happy, can't get sad
It's hard to do

When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you
It's hard to do
When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you

I stay home
Just to get locked in different rooms
It's the presence that you feel
I swear it holds some type of truth

Can't get happy, can't get sad
It's hard to do

When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you
It's hard to do
When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you

I would've woke you up
But you're so far gone
At that point of the night, usually
Of the night, usually
Why'd you, see you could lie
Home so you could lie to me
About all of the shooting stars, that you see
Shooting stars that you see

'Cause you are so smart
I am so weak
Could you please explain to me
You stayed shallow, while I went too deep

I'm scared to be living by the ocean, living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean

I fell to my knees
While the waves hit me like I was on the beach
This has nothing to do with you it's me versus me
I designed this world, custom t-shirts, and everything
Maybe if I was on tour
Maybe if I was with the boys
But I'm not and I'm not
And it's not about you and me
It's about everybody else

'Cause you are so smart
I am so weak
Could you please explain to me
You stayed shallow, I went too deep

I'm scared to be living by the ocean, living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean

I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared

In a half hour
I'll be fine
The next 29 minutes
Are gonna flow like concrete

My heart'll get so low
It could touch my feet
So just leave me alone
There's nothin' I need

I'll feel better
I'll feel better

I will admit the lows keep me alive
If it wasn't for the changes
I would probably die

Like how the dark never seems
That dark when it's finally light
My concentration is a knot
But this depression keeps it tight

I'll feel better
I'll feel better

I'm like the cold dead winter
Finally looking for the spring
You're the nice warm sun
You give birth to everything

Like a patient coming out of surgery
I remember how to feel
Like a traumatized victim
The past half hour wasn't real

I'll feel better
I'll feel better

So make up lies
And convince yourself they're true
Who am I to tell you what to do?

In a half hour
I'll be fine
The next 29 minutes
Are gonna flow like concrete

Two times in one night, two nights in a row
It's fine, I'm alright, but I will never let it go
It's cool, it's just getting old, it was never personal
Two times in one night, two nights in a row

And I have no idea what you're going through, so I won't act like I do

The silence in between the songs, it catches everyone off guard
If it's a little too much to bear right now, you can look forward to showing off the scars
It's the way you hold it in that carves your face out like a shell
Two times in the same night, but I'll probably never tell

'Cause I have no idea what you're going through, so I won't act like I do

I would sleep better on your floor than I would ever in my bed
And if your carpet makes my face itch, it'd still be heaven in my head
I would stop doing all those things the doctor tells me not to do
But I don't think he understands I do all of these things for you

Like I do

Well every once in awhile she’ll find my number in her phone and we’ll talk for hours
She’ll tell me things I would have never known about when we were together
She’s saying sorry, it’s just such a long walk home
So she’s coming over cause it’s better than being alone

Well I will move to the city and I will sleep on a bench in central park
And I will make new friends and we can keep all our things in shopping carts
And when the cops come to find me new friends will hide me
We will steal whatever we need for fun
And if they get suspicious it means all my new friends will run

Well I’m not gonna sit here and deny what I think I felt
I want what we had, just wanna feel it with someone else
I'm not gonna sit here and deny what I'm pretty sure I felt
I want what we had, just wanna feel it with someone else

Well every once in a while she’ll stumble on my number in her phone
And she drinks too much, and I’ve gotta get my number out of her phone
Because she has the nerve to call me and tell me she loves me
and that she’s tired of being alone
So she’s coming over because I’m a bitch and don’t know how to say no

I just wasn’t ready
I just wasn’t cool yet
I didn’t know what I wanted
But I should have known
What I would probably get

I just wasn’t ready
I just wasn’t cool yet
I didn’t know what I wanted
But I should have known
What I would probably get

I just wasn’t ready
I just wasn’t cool yet
I didn’t know what I wanted
But I should have known
What I would probably get

I just wasn’t ready
I just wasn’t cool yet
I didn’t know what I wanted
But I should have known
What I would probably get

I’m not gonna sit here and deny what I’m pretty sure I felt
I want what we had, just wanna feel it with someone else.

I was on LSD when I saved that family
And I was on LSD at all the talk shows after
Cause Jackie slapped me at a family party last year
He mumbled something, I mumbled something back

Neither of us said anything after that
Neither of us said anything after that

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon

Back at school I was anxious
Played it cool, let other people do the stressing for me
I'm a fool to feel anxious
When something dies that's it, it's dead, I gotta let it be

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon

Guided by a confused lie
I am guided by a confused light
I see the future in mysterious ways
I'm just a tie dye dragon

I guess I'm older now
I guess I'm older now
I am caught in between who I am and who I'm supposed to be
Everything's confusing
Everything's confusing
Everything's confusing
Everything's confusing

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon

Guided by a confused lie
I am guided by a confused light
I see the future in mysterious ways
I'm just a tie dye dragon

Behind your anguish
Pools a passionate rage
Behind your rage
Is even more rage
Are you ready to step
Inside of the cage?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Cause I feel so alive
And Harvard's gonna burn
Harvard burn a-burn a-burn a-burn
Havard's gonna burn
Hey all you crimson clowns
Don't you know Havard's going down?
We're gonna make you crawl
From your ivy-covered walls
And I feel so alive
And Harvard's gonna burn
Harvard burn burn burn a-burn
Havard's gonna burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn burn
And I feel so alive
And Harvard's gonna burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn
Burn Harvard burn burn
Harvard's gonna burn
And Harvard's gonna burn
Harvard's gonna burn burn burn
Harvard's gonna burn

(How did I get here?)
We are smoke, living on your parents' property
It's a joke, so we don't take it seriously
Fight's not worth the drama
Sounds like something that you said
Only bad examples left
All the good ones dead

And to think I was having a mental breakdown
The same time you were painting your walls
Found my love, born to obey
When I'm away, I think of kissing you every day

Sour but I think I like it
Fruit from the profane communion
Who knew I would even try it?
Now I wear camouflage to blend in
I wear camouflage to blend in
I wear camouflage to blend in

(I don't know where I am)
I don't know where I am
(How did I get here?)
I probably look like a psycho
They're probably calling the cops on me right now
In a universe parallel

And you can tell I was having a nervous breakdown
The same time you were making that call
Found my love, born to obey
When I'm away, I think of kissing you every day

Sour but I think I like it
Fruit from the profane communion
Who knew I would even try it?
Now I wear camouflage to blend in
I wear camouflage to blend in
I wear camouflage to blend in

I gotta make a commitment
And it's stressing me out
One I'm gonna have to live with
'Til I'm under the ground
And I will save it for my deathbed
Like I'm reading a vow
Or a police report
Feels like a poem somehow

It's all the the time I talk about vacation
Like it's all we got in common
Just let me take you on vacation
Just like I promised

I mean obviously I'm distant
I'm a thousand miles away
Obviously it's tense
There's nothing else to say
I am so loosely connected
In a couple different ways
And I might not act like it
But I think I love the taste

Louder but I think I like it
Fruit from the profane communion
Who knew I would even try it?
Now I wear camouflage to blend in
I wear camouflage to blend in
I wear camouflage to blend in
I wear camouflage to blend in
I wear camouflage to blend in

I wear camouflage to blend in
I wear camouflage to blend in
I wear camouflage to blend in
I wear camouflage to blend in

It was hard to tell
What it meant and how it felt

Crystal ball, crystal clear
I am far away from here
In my mind, a little nervous
Cause in a weird way, I deserve this
How was I supposed to know?
When in my heart, and in my mind
Everything seems to remind
When in my heart, and in my head
I try so hard to forget

I'm reminded
Of that summer
I'm reminded, of that summer, of that summer
Now I know what I shoulda did
Gone all day to the beach with you
Next time I know what I'll do
I'm gonna go all day to the beach with you

Your long hair, I comb it with my fingers while we wait
I will love you, until my hair falls out or all turns gray
You sleep, I sleep, watch TV, like tea leaves
Play video games, it's all the same
Everything I do negatively affects my brain
But I deserve it, and you deserve it too

I'm reminded
Of that summer
I'm reminded, of the summer, of that summer
Now I know what I shoulda did
Gone all day to the beach with you
Next time I know what I'll do
I'm gonna go all day to the beach with you
Hindsight twenty twenty true but at the time I didn't know what to do

And now I know what I shoulda did
Gone all day to the beach with you
Next time I know what I'll do
I'm gonna go all day to the beach with you

Now I know what I shoulda did
Gone all day to the beach with you
Next time I know what I'll do
I'm gonna go all day to the beach with you
Hindsight twenty twenty true but at the time I didn't know what to do

Everyone blooms in their own time
Some far ahead, some far behind
So wherever you are, don't worry, you're gonna be fine, fine, fine
'Cause everyone blooms in their own time

Sometimes we talk about what it might take
Skills to wrap the gift and my hands cut the cake
Sometimes we talk about what it might take
Skills to pay the bills and my mouth get a taste

I have to concentrate, keep it warm
Taking up space and blocking doors
Sometimes we talk, it's a total mistake
Just a picture of us looks so good it feels fake
Just a picture of us looks so good it feels fake

Everyone blooms in their own time
Some far ahead, some far behind
So wherever you are, don't worry, you're gonna be fine, fine, fine
'Cause everyone blooms in their own time

Oh, in their own time

Well, I heard that you want all of me
And I heard that you'd do anything
You can take what's left of me
Fill a garbage bag before you leave

I have to meditate, staying strong
Smoke's filling up space, no fire alarm
Sometimes we talk, it's a total mistake
Just the memories of us feel so real, must be fake
Good memories of us feel so real, must be fake

Everyone blooms in their own time
Some far ahead, some far behind
So wherever you are, don't worry, you're gonna be fine, fine, fine
Everyone blooms in their own time

Their own time
Their own time

Both of us could give up
Give up and float backwards
Attitude and outlook
Realize that it matters
And I know that no news
No news is good news
But that always felt backwards
And I still haven't heard from you
Attitude and outlook
Realize that it matters
Both of us could give up
Give up and float backwards
Yeah I know that no news
No news is good news
But that always felt backwards
And I still haven't heard from you
My attitude, my outlook
I realize now it matters
My attitude, my outlook
I realize now it matters
Yeah I know that no news
No news is good news
I realize now it matters
And I still haven't heard from you

Everyone blooms in their own time
Some far ahead, some far behind
So wherever you are, don't worry, you're gonna be fine, fine, fine
Gonna be fine, fine, fine
Gonna be fine, fine, fine
'Cause everyone blooms in their own time

Now is not the time to get numb
Even though you wanna be
Only thing to do is show off
To every single refugee

I've done drugs in the past
Burn so good, gone too fast
But now is not the time to get numb
Even though you wanna be

When you go somewhere new
It's hard to see the bad
When you meet someone new
It's hard to see the sad

I've done drugs in the past
Burn so good, gone too fast

Now is not the time to get numb
Even though you wanna be
Only thing to do is show off
To every single refugee

I've done drugs in the past
Burn so good, gone too fast
But now is not the time to get numb
Even though you wanna be

I'm just gonna say the same words, maybe it'll sink in

When you go somewhere new
It's hard to see the bad
When you meet someone new
It's hard to see the sad

Wave of hate, give and take
Realize way too late

Now is not the time to get numb
Even though you wanna be
Only thing to do is show off
To every single refugee

I've done drugs in the past
Burn so good, gone too fast
But now is not the time to get numb
Even though you wanna be

Even though you wanna be
Even though you wanna be
Even though you wanna be


See I was in handcuffs
No one stood by my side
No one to help me prove my charge was a lie
Well, some prosecutor screams "I'm a terrible guy"
That I am guilty and I deserve twenty-five to life

See I lost my temper
And the cop lost his cool
A whole can of pepper spray
Man, makin' me look like a fool

And he started stompin'
As I was gasping for air
Already on the ground
Man, I don't know
That fight don't seem fair

But with my pain came rage
A light so bright I feel blind
So I reach with my hands
And a rock is what I do find

He stops for a moment
I gather my strength
Just enough to swing quickly and put the rock right through his face

And that's how it happened
How he met his fate
And how my left eye got burned out by the pepper spray
Some called me a monster
Things got super intense
But I don't think I did nothin' wrong,
Your honor I claim self-defense

First they talk to his cop friends
And then they talk to his wife
They all said the same thing
He never hurt nothin' or no one in his whole life
They made it seem pretty obvious
That I was the one to blame
Even my public defender
Didn't have all that much to say

The jury comes back in
I try to look em' all in the eyes
Try to make em' feel like takin'
Another life that don't make takin'
The first one right and I hope that they realize
I hope they truly understand
Just how sorry I am, things got so outta' hand

I need the summer so bad or the windows down
On the ride home even though it's cold out

I need to cut my hair I need to make new friends
I need to lie about the things that make me who I am

I need my skin burned red I don’t care how it hurts
I need to cut the sleeves off all of my old t-shirts

Her boyfriend says pretend that it’s clean
Forget what they say and buy what you need
Cause money makes money it will make sense when you’re older
Your hands are so cold, I wish the winter was over

I wish the winter was over

Let’s put the number one thing in the number one spot
How rich are your parents? How much money do they got?

If it’s the second or third time it doesn’t even count
Shouldn’t have taken you that long to figure this out

I watch the sun slide along the sky
The longer it takes the more I feel alive

Her boyfriend says pretend that it’s clean
Forget what they say and buy what you need
Cause money makes money it will make sense when you’re older
Your hands are so cold, I wish the winter was over

I wish the winter was over

There’s notes at the crime scene
“Dear policemen, you can call me God.”
Wealthy prep school scholarship kid
It doesn’t make sense
No it doesn’t make any sense at all
To anyone other than the person you’re talking to

Her boyfriend says pretend that it’s clean
Forget what they say and buy what you need
Cause money makes money it will make sense when you’re older
Your hands are so cold, I wish the winter was over

I wish the winter was over

Swallow it down or spit it out but either way lets move along
I'm radioactive I'm in pieces but I am still feeling strong enough
to walk away from all of this the car is crashed I just don't care
my followers abandoned me cause Poppa bear was unprepared

If only you could hold me
my sweet sweet Joanie I know I'd be so brave right now
If only you could hold me
my sweet sweet Joanie I know I'd be so brave right now

Maybe I'll get back to you maybe I haven't learned a thing
Maybe it's the last time for you but it's not the last time for me
I love the things you have to pay for that knock you down and make you dizzy
I got distracted along the way shaking hands and looking busy

If only you could hold me
my sweet sweet Joanie I know I'd be so brave right now
If only you could hold me
my sweet sweet Joanie I know I'd be so brave right now
If only you could hold me
my sweet, sweet Joanie
oh, my one and only

Do you ever think maybe I could be one of those things
that you hate at first but eventually learn to love
and then trust and then touch and then cut yeah I bet you will
Yeah I bet you will

I took a lot of day trips, trying to get away trips
sorry I have cold lips nothing left to say lips
I'm calling double or nothing on everything I have
I finally am what I am a fucking bag of bags.

If only you could hold me (bag of bags)
my sweet sweet Joanie (bag of bags)
I know I'd be so brave right now (that's all I am)

If only you could hold me
my sweet sweet Joanie oh my one and only

Is it raining where you are
The only thing I could think to ask
But nothin ever hurt so bad
As the no that you said back
But ain't that the truth man
Those are just facts
The farther you go from where you start
The harder it is to get back
In order to figure things out
I gotta get real real confused
I'm just tryin to figure out what I've started man
I'm just doin what I need to do

Love of my life
Gone forever
Love of my life
Gone for good
Love of my life
Gone forever
Get her back good lord
You know I wish I could

I tried to explain
I tried to explain to you
That everything I'm doing right now
Won't pay off for another year or two
I never thought that it'd get so far
But now I'm doin what I gotta do
I understand that business is business
And I hope that you do too
I do not blame you
Your natural instinct to protect
Gave me a list of things to keep this going
And I only got a few more things to get
This one's for the privacy I think that I deserve
No you can not join in
God damn these people got some nerve

Leave me alone
I'm tryin to get in the zone
Leave me alone
I'm tryin to get in the zone
Love of my life
Gone forever
Love of my life
Gone for good

Frozen with fear,
Stuck to where you are standing,
Open your mind,
Noodle monster is expanding!

It's a noodle monster baby!

Remember that time,
You got hit with that wet noodle?
You know where you are!

You're in the jungle!

Noodle monster!
Noodle monster!

Hello?
Learn to love...

Take an inch, take it slow.
Take it easy man, everybody already knows.
Learn to love, cause you got love to give.
And who knows, cause your darkest days, they may have already been.

Playing good cop, bad cop kind of games
Never just standing out of wink or something
He cut his throat with a shard of a stain glass window
And the cameras never saw it coming
No, the cameras never saw it coming
The security cameras never saw it coming.

And it was all to see who could ride a motorcycle the fastest,
As for me I still believe, I still believe, I still believe
And it was all to see who could ride a motorcycle the fastest,
As for me I still believe.

I'm from the east coast chapter of the MRA,
Those were the very last words they heard him say
As a lightning bolt came down
And went through him before it hit the ground.
On some nights there's something cool to do
On some nights there's nothing to do at all
I guess it's cool for right now, just like everything else.

You're lying next to me, it feels like I'm 6 foot 5
I've never felt so brave and strong and sexy at the same time.
(I've never felt so cold or scared or lonely at the same time)
Brave and strong and sexy and alive.
(Cold or scared or lonely at the same time)
Sexy and alive.
(Lonely at the same time)

And it was all to see who could ride a motorcycle the fastest,
As for me I still believe, I still believe, oh I still believe
And it was all to see who could ride a motorcycle the fastest,
As for me I still believe.

You were feelin' bad for me, I was feelin' bad for you
We've both had a little time, not much for us to do
Shut all of the lights out before you open up the door
You said your parents weren't home, but I wanna make sure

So if you're lonely, or you just want me around,
Call me up, I'm sure I'd be down.

And I, and I, and I don't wanna make my mark on anything
I just wanna show up then leave without anyone noticing

Your friends will say you lost, mine'll say at least we tried
And times were pretty good before they started to unwind
So shut all of the lights out before you open up the door
You said your parents weren't home, but I wanna make sure

So if you're lonely, or you just want me around,
Call me up, I'm sure I'd be down

And I, and I, and I don't wanna make my mark on anything
I just wanna show up then leave without anyone noticing

The bass is too loud, the bass is too loud
The bass is too loud, the walls are too thin, it’s making it hard to sleep
While God helps those who help themselves, he ain’t done much for me
And our relationship is changing, it’s not such a bad thing, it’s just not what it used to be
And it doesn’t make it better when I save up all my money, then you tell me you could get it for free
Just stop, it doesn’t even matter anymore

'Cause it is darker than black, and it’s lighter than white
It's the things I thought were dead in me that are comin' to life
And it's a happy time, but the last thing I need
When every other person here wants every other to leave

The bass is too loud, the walls are too thin, it’s making it hard to sleep
And I probably should have gone to the hospital, but I decided to let it bleed
And our relationship is changing, it’s not such a bad thing, it’s just not what it used to be
And it doesn’t make it better when I save up all my money, then you tell me you could get it for free
So just stop, just stop, so just stop
It doesn't even matter anymore (oh, just stop)

'Cause it is darker than black, and it’s lighter than white
It's the things I thought were dead in me that are comin' to life
It's a happy time, but the last thing I need
When every other person here wants every other to leave

And it's darker than black, and it’s lighter than white
It's the things I thought were dead in me that are comin' to life
And it's a happy time, but the last thing I need
When every other person here wants every other to leave

Just stop
Every other to leave
Wants every other to leave

The bass is too loud, the walls are too thin (wants every other to leave)
The bass is too loud, the walls are too thin (wants every other to leave)
The bass is too loud, the walls are too thin (wants every other to leave)
The bass is too loud, the walls are too thin (wants every other to leave)
Walls are too thin. Walls are too thin (wants ever other to leave)
Walls are too thin. Walls are too thin. Walls are too thin

The light sneaks in from under the door
I don't know where I am, but I've been here before
I found a message on the table, it's signed by you
It says "I'm sorry for your loss, there's not much I can do"
And when they ask how long it's been this way,
Say not that long, just a couple of days
But you and I know that's not true
I've been living this way since the day I met you

And I could see myself never fully recovering
And I could see myself turning blue
And I could see myself never fully recovering
And I could see myself dying for you

If I don't leave now, then I'll be late
But if I show up on time, you'll call me fake
And don't give me shit, I put my money in
I thought that I'd be late, where the fuck have you been?
And what we had did not last long,
But the memories flood back when I sing this song
I want back everything I ever gave
And when they ask where I am, say "diggin' his grave"

And I could see myself never fully recovering
And I could see myself turning blue
And I could see myself never fully recovering
And I could see myself dying for. I could see myself dying for
I could see myself dying for you. Dying for you.

I'm from the future
That's the last thing they'll hear me say
As I begin to uncontrollably shake
So please allow me to shed some darkness
Step into a summer time zone, oh
I don't care if you people like me
It won't make a difference if you don't

Cause I'm gonna tighten up
My circle soon as I get some real money
So enjoy this Mr. Big Spender side of me
While it lasts

Don't feel bad for me
No don't feel bad for me
Don't feel bad for me
No don't feel bad for me
No don't feel bad for me
I won't feel bad for you

I'm gonna start a cult
A cult of happy people
Who I will have to kill eventually
For they know not what they know

Don't feel bad for them
No don't feel bad for them
No don't feel bad for them
No don't feel bad for them
No don't feel bad for them
They won't feel bad for you

You hurt me but it ain't all that bad
You hurt me but it ain't all that bad
You hurt me but it ain't all that bad
You hurt me but it ain't all that bad

You wouldn't even recognize me no more, I've changed
I can roll a cigarette with my eyes closed, too hot to feel pain
You hurt me but it ain't all that bad
You hurt me but it ain't all that bad

He says he knows how to freestyle
And he will show us if we give him a beat
He says he spent six years in jail
For selling two fake crack rocks to some undercover police

Don't feel bad for him
No don't feel bad for him
No don't feel bad for him
No don't feel bad for him
No don't feel bad for him
He won't feel bad for you

I never done it, only sold it
To a couple of my friends and now they're telling me that they feel fine
And it's a backwards way of thinking
But it's all that I got so I will keep it in the back of my mind

And it's a lonely conversation with a stranger I met
Asking me what I'm gonna do tonight
But I will never sleep again, so you can come on over
I bet you think we both could work out fine

And it's a phone call, says you hate me
Your boyfriend wants to know where I've been
But it's a waste of time, you see I've lost weight
My bones are practically sticking through my skin

And it's a question of religion, a question I want answered
An answer that is in myself
But I am absent, and I am hollow
Most of the time I think I'm someone else

And I am bored, just like a summer cop
Thinking what I'm doing's gonna make a difference
And I keep screaming and asking him to stop
But I doubt he will because he never listens

My bed is small but I cannot complain because it won't make a difference
You could come over if that is what you decide
And we could both stay up
Try to watch the sun rise

And it's a phone call, says you hate me
Your boyfriend wants to know where I've been
But it's a waste of time, you see I've lost weight
My bones are practically sticking through my skin

And it's a question of religion, a question I want answered
It's an answer that is in myself
But I am absent, and I am hollow
Most of the time I think I'm someone else

But it's a phone call (it's a phone call), says you hate me (why do you hate me?)
Your boyfriend wants to know where I've been (why do you hate me?)
But it's a waste of time
You see I've lost weight
Oh, well my bones are practically sticking
Practically sticking
Through my skin (through my skin)
Through my skin (through my skin)
Through my skin
Through my skin (why do you hate me?)
Why do you hate me?

Ah, but it's a phone call, says you hate me
Your boyfriend wants to know where I've been
But it's a waste of time, you see I've lost weight
My bones are practically sticking through my skin (they're sticking through my skin)

And it's a question of religion, a question I want answered
It's an answer that is in myself (I got questions, I got questions)
But I am absent, and I am hollow
Most of the time I think I'm someone else

Deep and slow, but that's how it goes
If anyone asks, yeah I already know
Cause I got this pain in my chest
Every time I swim to consciousness
And I misspelled every word perfectly
Every mistake made was purposely
And my head is pounding to the beat of my heart

You are a broken heart tattoo
I'll have forever on my chest
For a love that I have lost
But never could forget

Say what you have to say
Try not to cry
This is just not what you wanted
At this point in your life
It's so hard to stay
When all you want to do is ride
I totally get you, I was a birdcage
And you were meant to fly

You are a broken heart tattoo
I'll have forever on my chest
For a love that I have lost
But never will forget

I shook ‘til I came out of it [x4]
Let’s sit down, we’ll sit down proud
We’ll sit down proud
We’ll sit down

Nothing matters, the importance of nothing [x3]
That's what you taught me
While I was barely listening
Nothing matters, the importance of nothing [x3]
Nothing matters, nothing matters
