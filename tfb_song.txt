[VERSE 1]
And I wanna go back to you but They'll ask me when you're uncomfortable.
I never will see you tomorrow But I can't be happy
I’m gonna go crazy I am washing my hair with soap 
Yes I am a fucking bag of bags.
There is no way you want to die.
Let's talk about how it felt the same.

[CHORUS]
I'll paint my face in Baltimore 
right before we both know where you are
Why do you think I watched this girl being choked By a man with muscles 
And I will not deny the privilege to someone else 
who wants my love I would do anything for it.
It's such a fucking bag of bags.

[VERSE 2]
do you think my expressions should match 
it is probably just my friends that won't even matter when I leave 
Hey Molly, how you doin'? Let's talk about this later?
She sees my plane in the front seat, I’m too tall.
You're in love and how it felt the same.
There is no way you want it to.

[BRIDGE]
Let's talk about how it felt the same.
It's unfortunate, my attitude, I need some inspiration for my story.
Let's talk about how it felt the same.
It's unfortunate, my attitude, I need some inspiration for my story.

[HOOK]
Cause I feel inside, the way you want it to.
I am a fucking bag of bags.[x8]
